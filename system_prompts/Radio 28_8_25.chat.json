If you need to detect that, check for HTTP 403/451 responses or player errors and log the HTTP status. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations?utm_source=openai))\n\n1) Python: validate & probe HLS with retries + timeout (requests + ffprobe)\n- Purpose: check HEAD, fetch playlist, optionally run ffprobe to confirm audio codec.\n- Requirements: requests, subprocess with ffprobe/ffmpeg installed.\n\nExample (synchronous, robust):\n```python\nimport requests\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nSTREAMS = [\n    (\"triplej_nsw\",\"https://mediaserviceslive.akamaized.net/hls/live/2038308/triplejnsw/index.m3u8\"),\n    (\"abc_newsradio\",\"https://mediaserviceslive.akamaized.net/hls/live/2038311/newsradio/index.m3u8\"),\n]\n\nHEADERS = {\"User-Agent\": \"MyRadioApp/1.0\"}\nTIMEOUT = 10\nRETRIES = 3\nBACKOFF = 2\n\ndef fetch_with_retries(url):\n    for attempt in range(1, RETRIES+1):\n        try:\n            r = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=TIMEOUT)\n            r.raise_for_status()\n            return r.text\n        except Exception as e:\n            if attempt == RETRIES:\n                raise\n            time.sleep(BACKOFF * attempt)\n\ndef probe_with_ffprobe(url):\n    # Returns dict or None\n    cmd = [\"ffprobe\",\"-v\",\"error\",\"-show_entries\",\"format:stream\",\"-print_format\",\"json\", url]\n    p = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=20)\n    if p.returncode == 0:\n        import json\n        return json.loads(p.stdout)\n    return None\n\nfor name, url in STREAMS:\n    print(\"Testing\", name, url)\n    try:\n        playlist = fetch_with_retries(url)\n        print(\"Playlist size:\", len(playlist))\n        meta = probe_with_ffprobe(url)\n        if meta:\n            print(\"ffprobe streams:\", [s.get(\"codec_name\") for s in meta.get(\"streams\",[] )])\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Failed:\", e)\n```\nThis code uses retries/timeouts and falls back to ffprobe to confirm the stream. For production use, add exponential backoff, async concurrency (aiohttp) and logging.\n\n2) Using Playwright to automate opening a station page and extracting the HLS URL (useful if the station page embeds a player but you can’t find the direct link)\n- Requirements: playwright python\n```python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\nimport re\n\ndef find_hls_from_page(station_page_url):\n    with sync_playwright() as p:\n        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)\n        page = browser.new_page()\n        page.goto(station_page_url, timeout=30000)\n        html = page.content()\n        browser.close()\n        # look for .m3u8 links in page html or JS\n        m = re.findall(r\"https?://[^\\s'\\\">]+\\.m3u8\", html)\n        return list(dict.fromkeys(m))  # unique\n\nprint(find_hls_from_page(\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/\"))\n```\nPlaywright is handy for pages that dynamically inject stream URLs. Most ABC network pages include the HLS ID string or the player config.\n\n3) Caching station metadata & artwork (simple JSON + local caching)\n- Save station metadata (name, url, logo_url, last_checked) in a small SQLite DB or JSON file; store artwork file locally and update periodically.\n\nExample (concept):\n```python\nimport json, os, time, requests\n\nCACHE_FILE = \"abc_radio_cache.json\"\nIMG_DIR = \"station_art\"\n\nos.makedirs(IMG_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n\ndef load_cache():\n    if os.path.exists(CACHE_FILE):\n        return json.load(open(CACHE_FILE))\n    return {}\n\ndef save_cache(cache):\n    json.dump(cache, open(CACHE_FILE,\"w\"), indent=2)\n\ncache = load_cache()\nstation = {\"id\":\"triplej_nsw\",\"name\":\"triple j NSW\",\n           \"stream\":\"https://mediaserviceslive.akamaized.net/hls/live/2038308/triplejnsw/index.m3u8\",\n           \"logo\":\"https://www.abc.net.au/res/sites/abc/img/triplej.png\"}\n\ncache[station[\"id\"]] = { **station, \"last_checked\": int(time.time()) }\n# download artwork if missing or older than 7 days\nimg_path = os.path.join(IMG_DIR, station[\"id\"]+\".png\")\nif (not os.path.exists(img_path)) or (time.time() - os.path.getmtime(img_path) > 7*24*3600):\n    r = requests.get(station[\"logo\"], timeout=10)\n    if r.ok:\n        open(img_path,\"wb\").write(r.content)\nsave_cache(cache)\n```\n\nLegal / geo / practical notes\n- These endpoints are ABC’s official HLS streams. Some coverage (notably some sporting events) may be blocked outside Australia; hitting a player error or HTTP 403/451 indicates geo or rights limits. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations?utm_source=openai))\n- If you need fallback MP3/AAC endpoints (for legacy devices), ABC Classic has MediaHub MP3/AAC URLs (time-delayed streams) — see ABC Classic time-delayed streams.

Which do you want?\n\nBelow are the files and scripts.\n\n-- 1) JSON mapping (abc_abc_streams.json)\nSave the JSON below as abc_abc_streams.json.

If the playlist redirects or returns a master playlist, ffprobe may be able to inspect the streams; many HLS playlists are playable by ffmpeg/players.\n- Some streams may be geo-blocked or require specific headers/cookies; the script logs exceptions and will record HTTP error codes (403/451/404, etc).\n- Running ffprobe from outside Australia may yield false negatives for sport or rights-protected streams (ffprobe may see 403). If you need me to run the test from here, tell me and I will run it and return the report (but note possible geo-restriction). The ABC Help page warns that sport coverage can be restricted outside Australia. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n\n-- 4) Playwright automation script (extract_hls_with_playwright.py)\nThis script demonstrates how to open an ABC radio page and extract any .m3u8 URLs injected into the page or player config. It can be adapted to crawl multiple station pages. Requirements: playwright for Python, install via `pip install playwright` and run `playwright install`.\n\nScript (sync API):\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\nimport re\nimport json\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\n\ndef extract_hls_from_page(url, headless=True, timeout=30000):\n    found = set()\n    with sync_playwright() as p:\n        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=headless)\n        page = browser.new_page()\n        page.goto(url, timeout=timeout)\n        # Wait a little for player scripts to load (adjust as needed)\n        page.wait_for_timeout(2000)\n        html = page.content()\n        # find explicit .m3u8 links in markup or inline scripts\n        for m in re.findall(r'https?://[^\\'\"\\\\s<>]+\\.m3u8', html):\n            found.add(m)\n        # inspect network requests to catch player-loaded endpoints\n        for req in page.context.network.requests:\n            u = req.url\n            if u.endswith(\".m3u8\"):\n                found.add(u)\n        # Some players use JSON config objects; search for 'playlist' or 'hls' keys\n        for m in re.findall(r'[\"\\'](https?://[^\\'\"\\\\s]+/index\\.m3u8)[\"\\']', html):\n            found.add(m)\n        browser.close()\n    return list(found)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    page = \"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/\"  # example — change to any ABC station page\n    print(\"Extracting HLS from\", page)\n    urls = extract_hls_from_page(page)\n    print(\"Found\", len(urls), \"HLS links:\")\n    for u in urls:\n        print(u)\n\nNotes:\n- Use the network inspection loop to capture player-initiated requests. If the player uses a streaming proxy or tokenized URLs, you may need to capture ephemeral request headers/cookies; Playwright can intercept requests and save headers if required.\n- When crawling many station pages, add rate limiting and respect ABC robots/terms. The Help article provides official stream endpoints, but pages may embed additional metadata (logos, fallback MP3 endpoints, etc.) you can capture. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n\n-- 5) Artwork and metadata caching (example code)\nA short snippet to fetch station logos and cache them next to the JSON (this helps media apps show thumbnails). You can expand to use sqlite/db or S3 for cloud storage.\n\nimport os, json, time, requests\nCACHE_DIR = \"station_cache\"\nIMG_DIR = os.path.join(CACHE_DIR, \"logos\")\nos.makedirs(IMG_DIR, exist_ok=True)\nwith open(\"abc_abc_streams.json\") as f:\n    stations = json.load(f)[\"stations\"]\n# Quick heuristic to find logos on ABC site if you don't have direct logo urls:\nfor st in stations:\n    sid = st[\"id\"]\n    # simple guess: logos often live on abc.net.au/res/sites/abc/img/<slug>.png\n    # You should adapt this per-station by crawling station pages (Playwright).\n    guessed = f\"https://www.abc.net.au/res/sites/abc/media/images/stations/{sid}.png\"\n    outp = os.path.join(IMG_DIR, sid + \".png\")\n    try:\n        r = requests.get(guessed, timeout=6)\n        if r.status_code == 200 and int(r.headers.get(\"Content-Length\",\"0\"))>0:\n            open(outp,\"wb\").write(r.content)\n            st[\"logo_local\"] = outp\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n# Save augmented metadata\nopen(\"abc_abc_streams_with_logos.json\",\"w\").write(json.dumps({\"stations\":stations}, indent=2))\n\n(For best results: use the Playwright script to visit each station page and scrape the explicit logo URL and open-graph tags — these are usually reliable.)\n\n-- 6) Legal / practical notes\n- All HLS URLs above are from ABC’s official Help article (Jan 20, 2025). Use of official endpoints is the recommended route. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n- Some streams (especially ABC Sport/itinerant sport feeds) may be geo-restricted outside Australia. If you see HTTP 403/451 or player errors, that usually indicates rights restrictions. The script logs HTTP status codes so you can filter those cases. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n- If you need legacy MP3/AAC endpoints (e.g., ABC Classic time-delayed MP3/AAC), I can add those too (ABC documents time-delayed endpoints on the ABC site). Ask and I’ll include them. (I can fetch and add these if you want.) ([abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/listenapp?utm_source=openai), [help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n\n-- 7) Do you want me to run the probe now?\nI can run the probe script from my environment and return a results.zip containing:\n- results_streams_report.json (full details per station)\n- results_streams_report.csv (summary)\n- any ffprobe JSON outputs (if ffprobe is available)\n- a log of errors/timeouts\n\nBefore I run:\n- Note: some sport/geo-limited streams may be blocked from my execution environment and appear as 403/451 even though they work inside Australia. The ABC help page calls this out. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n- Running the probe will make outbound requests to ABC’s CDN (akamai/mediaserviceslive...). If that’s OK, confirm and I’ll run it and return the report.\n\nIf you prefer to run locally (recommended if you expect geo-restrictions to affect results), run these commands:\n- Save the JSON file as abc_abc_streams.json\n- Install reqs: pip install aiohttp aiofiles tqdm playwright\n- Install Playwright browsers if using Playwright: playwright install\n- Run: python probe_streams.py\n- Results will appear in results_streams_report.json and results_streams_report.csv\n\nWrap-up / next steps\n- I can immediately run the probe from here and upload the results (tell me “Run the probe now”). Note again the geo-restriction caveat for sport streams. ([help.abc.net.au](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/4402927208079-Where-can-I-find-direct-stream-URLs-for-ABC-Radio-stations))\n- Or I can (a) enrich the JSON with logo/artwork by crawling each station page via Playwright, (b) add the ABC Classic time-delayed MP3/AAC endpoints, and/or (c) produce a Docker image that runs the probe on a schedule and pushes results to S3/DB.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?\n- Run probe now and return the results (I will run the async probe + ffprobe if available).\n- Or just give you the files and scripts to run locally (you can also ask me to tweak concurrency/timeouts or to include MP3 fallback endpoints).\n\n\nYou: When is fathers day\n\nBot: Which country do you mean? (You’re likely in the United States, so I’ll give that first.)\n\n- United States (and Canada, most of the UK): Father’s Day is the third Sunday in June — in 2025 it was Sunday, June 15, 2025. The next one will be Sunday, June 21, 2026.\n- Australia / New Zealand: first Sunday in September — in 2025 it’s Sunday, September 7, 2025.\n- Germany (Vatertag): coincides with Ascension Day — in 2025 it was Thursday, May 29, 2025.\n\nWant the date for a different country or a reminder set for the next one?\n\nYou: Australia\n\nBot: In Australia Father's Day is observed on the first Sunday in September.\n\n- 2025: Sunday, 7 September 2025 (10 days from today, 28 August 2025).  \n- 2026: Sunday, 6 September 2026.  \n- 2027: Sunday, 5 September 2027.\n\nWant me to create a calendar reminder or an .ics file for 7 Sept 2025?\n\nYou: What are unit prices like in Quenbyan NSW\\\n\nBot: Do you mean Queanbeyan, NSW? (You typed “Quenbyan” — I’m assuming Queanbeyan 2620.) Here’s a concise snapshot of the unit (apartment) market with sources and dates.\n\nQuick headline\n- Typical unit (apartment) prices in Queanbeyan are roughly in the mid‑$400k range (different data providers report slightly different medians depending on date/method). ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai), [onthehouse.com.au](https://www.onthehouse.com.au/property/nsw/queanbeyan-2620?utm_source=openai))\n\nKey numbers and recent trend (with time stamps)\n- Median sale price (units): about $475,000 for the 12 months July 2024 → June 2025 (realestate.com.au median for units). ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Alternative estimate: OnTheHouse reports a median unit value of about $413,550 (snapshot reported as at 30 Sep 2024). This difference is normal — providers use different data windows and valuation models. ([onthehouse.com.au](https://www.onthehouse.com.au/property/nsw/queanbeyan-2620?utm_source=openai))  \n- Median unit rents: about $450 per week (realestate.com.au rental snapshot). ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/rent/in-queanbeyan%2C%2Bnsw%2B2620/list-1?utm_source=openai))  \n- Rental yield: typically reported around ~5% (realestate.com.au reports ~5.9% for units; other local broker data shows ~4.9% — expect yields in the mid‑4% to high‑5% range depending on the exact property and costs). ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai), [prd.com.au](https://www.prd.com.au/queanbeyan/suburb-information/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Size-based medians (realestate.com.au, July 2024–June 2025): 1‑bed ~ $310k, 2‑bed ~ $435k, 3‑bed ~ $651k. ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Short‑term growth: some providers show units rising year‑on‑year (realestate.com.au lists ~+11.8% over the prior 12 months for units in its reporting period), while CoreLogic‑sourced summaries show more modest gains — again this depends on exact date ranges and sample sizes. ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai), [yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au](https://www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au/top-suburbs/nsw/2620-queanbeyan?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhat that means in plain terms\n- Price band: expect most units to sit roughly $400k–$520k, with compact 1‑bed flats cheaper ($~300–350k) and newer/larger 2–3 bed apartments at the higher end. ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai), [onthehouse.com.au](https://www.onthehouse.com.au/property/nsw/queanbeyan-2620?utm_source=openai))  \n- Yield/Investor note: gross yields around 4.5–6% are commonly quoted, but net yield will be lower once strata fees, council rates and maintenance are included — factor those into calculations. ([realestate.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/nsw/queanbeyan-2620/?utm_source=openai), [prd.com.au](https://www.prd.com.au/queanbeyan/suburb-information/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Market drivers: proximity to Canberra (commuters), limited entry‑level stock in nearby Canberra pushing some demand into Queanbeyan, and local development/stock turnover affect short‑term prices and rents.

Use the “as at” date on any market snapshot when comparing. ([prd.com.au](https://www.prd.com.au/queanbeyan/suburb-insights/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Rental stock mix (units vs houses), new listings, and seasonal demand cause short‑term variation; inner suburb or newer apartment complexes can be above the medians, while older stock or smaller flats can be below them.

Thoughtful usually means noticing, remembering, and acting in ways that lighten her load and make her feel seen. Quick, practical ideas:\n\nFoundations\n- Ask what helps: “What would make this week easier for you?” and “Do you want comfort or solutions right now?”\n- Learn her preferences: note favorite coffee order, flowers, snacks, music, sizes, brands. Keep a shared or private note.\n- Own, don’t “help”: take full ownership of recurring tasks (e.g., groceries each week, car service, bill paying) so she doesn’t carry the mental load.\n\nDaily micro‑gestures\n- A specific compliment or thank‑you (what she did and why it mattered).\n- 10–15 minutes of undivided attention: phones away, just her agenda.\n- Small comforts: prep her water/tea, warm the car on cold days, set her side of the bed with a book light/charger.\n- Kind check‑ins: “Thinking of you—good luck with the 2 pm meeting.”\n\nReduce friction\n- Fix three tiny annoyances she mentions (squeaky door, slow laptop, cluttered entryway).\n- Preempt the next day: lay out breakfast items, pack the car, fill washer fluid, book the appointment she’s been postponing.\n\nQuality time\n- Plan a low‑effort date she’d pick: museum + bakery, hike + picnic, bookstore + coffee. Put it on the calendar, arrange logistics.\n- Create a no‑screens ritual: a walk after dinner, Sunday coffee, or midweek lunch.\n\nSupport her goals\n- Protect time for her hobby or workout; you cover everything else during that window.\n- Celebrate wins: small card or dessert when she hits milestones.\n\nWords and touch (if she likes them)\n- Short note on the mirror or in her bag.\n- Gentle touch as she passes; ask what kind of affection feels best and when.\n\nGifts, done thoughtfully\n- Replace something she uses daily with a nicer version, or restock her favorites.\n- Experiences over stuff: class together, day trip, or a surprise reservation she’s mentioned.\n\nWhen she’s stressed\n- Step in without asking: run bath, handle dinner, screen calls, tidy the space she needs.\n- Validate first: “That sounds exhausting; I can see why you’re upset.” Then ask if she wants help solving it.\n\nSimple 7‑day “be‑thoughtful” challenge\n- Day 1: Leave a note plus her favorite snack/drink.\n- Day 2: Take full ownership of one chore she dislikes (plan → do → clean up).\n- Day 3: 20‑minute no‑phone walk or couch chat focused on her day.\n- Day 4: Remove one nagging task from her list and report “handled.”\n- Day 5: Send a specific midday text about something she cares about.\n- Day 6: Plan and run a small date built around her interests.\n- Day 7: Ask, “What landed this week? What would you love more of next week?”\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Keeping score or expecting praise.\n- Big gestures but inconsistent basics.\n- Asking “What can I do?” in the moment—anticipate and act.\n\nWant me to tailor a one‑week plan to her? Share a few details: her current stressors, what she enjoys (words, time together, acts of service, small gifts, touch), and your typical week.\n\n\nYou: My 36 year anniversary is on 8-Sep-2025 , what should I do!\n\nBot: Congratulations on 36 years — that’s huge. Your date is Monday, September 8, 2025, so you’ve got about 11 days. Here’s a fast, low‑stress plan with options by effort/budget and a simple timeline you can act on today.\n\nQuick theme ideas (pick one)\n- 36 motif: 36 reasons I love you (handwritten), 36-photo collage, 36-minute dance/walk to “your” songs.\n- Traditional-ish: many lists suggest bone china or “antique” for the 36th. Think a beautiful tea set, an antique locket, or afternoon tea.\n- Recreate a first: first-date spot/menu, wedding song, or the place you said “yes.”\n\nThree ready-to-go celebration plans\n1) Luxe-at-home evening (easy, intimate)\n- Set the scene: flowers, candles, your wedding song, printed 36-reasons card.\n- Dinner: chef-delivered meal kit or favorite takeout plated on nice dishes; chill a bottle she loves.\n- Surprise: a small piece of jewelry or an “experience IOU” for the coming weekend.\n- Finish: slideshow on the TV or a video montage from family.\n\n2) Mini-getaway (weekend before/after)\n- One night within 1–2 hours of home (boutique inn or hot springs). Book dinner and breakfast now.\n- Personal touch: a framed throwback photo for the room and a handwritten note on the pillow.\n- Activity: something she’d pick—spa treatment, garden/museum visit, coastal drive, or a scenic hike + picnic.\n\n3) Memory walk + dinner (weekday-friendly)\n- After work Monday: sunset walk somewhere meaningful, then a reservation at her favorite place.\n- Gift: an antique or bone‑china tea for two; or a custom map print of a meaningful place (wedding/first home).\n- Dessert at home with a playlist from your years together.\n\nIf you want one special gift\n- Meaningful: upgrade something she uses daily (bag, robe, headphones) or an heirloom‑style locket with a tiny photo.\n- Experience: class together (pottery, cooking, dance), tickets to a show, or a “yes day” you plan around her favorites.\n- Personal: compile 36 notes from family/friends about what they admire about her.\n\nSimple timeline (so nothing slips)\n- Today (Aug 28): pick a plan and book the reservation/hotel; arrange childcare/pets if needed. Order flowers for delivery on Sep 8. Start a shared album to gather photos.\n- 3–5 days before: print one photo, write your 36 reasons, assemble a small gift. Confirm bookings, outfit, and transport.\n- Sep 8 morning (Mon): place a note where she’ll find it + her favorite coffee/snack.\n- Midday: have flowers or a small dessert delivered to her workplace/home with a short message.\n- Evening: your chosen plan (home dinner, special reservation, or memory walk), then a toast and a slow dance.\n\nWords you can use (short and real)\n- “Thirty-six years of choosing you. I still learn from you, I still laugh because of you, and I still can’t wait to see you walk into a room.”\n- “Thank you for the ordinary days we turned into a life.”\n\nBudget trims and upgrades\n- Trim: home-cooked version of her favorite restaurant dish; print photos at a local kiosk; flowers from a farmer’s market.\n- Upgrade: car service to dinner; private dining room; overnight suite with rose petals and late checkout.\n\nWant me to tailor this? Tell me:\n- Her top 2–3 likes (food, music, places), whether she prefers experiences, useful gifts, words, or touch, and your approximate budget. I’ll turn it into a specific, bookable plan for Sep 8.\n\n\nYou: I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14.

Can you help me?\n\nBot: Yes. Solve step by step:\n\n- 3x + 11 = 14\n- Subtract 11: 3x = 3\n- Divide by 3: x = 1\n- Check: 3(1) + 11 = 14\n\nAnswer: x = 1.\n\nYou: I need to solve the equations 3x + 11y = 14 & 2x + 12y =13 for x and y. Can you help me?\n\nBot: Yes.

      "content": "Summary of earlier conversation: The conversation began with the user requesting streaming URLs for all ABC Australian radio stations. The assistant clarified whether the user wanted just national networks or every local/territory station, and which stream format was preferred. The user confirmed they wanted all stations, including regional ones. The assistant then supplied an extensive set of official ABC HLS (.m3u8) endpoints sourced from ABC’s Help pages, covering national networks (ABC NewsRadio, Radio National with state variants, triple j and Double J state variants, ABC Classic and Classic 2, ABC Jazz, ABC Country, ABC Kids listen), capital-city ABC Local Radio feeds (Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney), numerous regional/local stations across NSW, QLD, SA, TAS, VIC, WA, and NT, plus ABC Sport (Grandstand) and itinerant sport streams, and Radio Australia (English and multilingual). It also noted ABC Classic time‑delayed MP3/AAC endpoints and included brief guidance on playback, geo‑restriction, and testing.\n\nThe user asked the assistant to “do all three things” previously suggested. The assistant delivered: (1) a complete JSON mapping of station IDs, names, URLs, and group/region fields based on the ABC Help article (dated Jan 20, 2025); (2) a comprehensive M3U playlist containing all listed stations; and (3) a robust Python probe script using asyncio/aiohttp to fetch playlists, retry with backoff, optionally run ffprobe, and export results to JSON/CSV. The assistant also provided (4) a Playwright script to discover embedded HLS URLs on ABC pages, and (5) an example for caching artwork/metadata. It added notes on legal/geo considerations, offered to run the probe and return a results bundle (with the caveat of possible geo‑blocking for sport), and gave local run instructions and dependencies.\n\nThe user then asked, “When is Father’s Day.” The assistant requested the country and offered quick references: third Sunday in June for the US (and Canada/most of the UK), first Sunday in September for Australia/New Zealand, and Ascension Day for Germany. When the user specified Australia, the assistant confirmed it’s the first Sunday in September and listed the next dates (2025: 7 September; 2026: 6 September; 2027: 5 September), and offered to create a calendar reminder/.ics file.\n\nThe conversation shifted to property prices in “Quenbyan NSW,” which the assistant clarified as Queanbeyan (NSW 2620). It provided a concise market snapshot for units, citing sources such as realestate.com.au and OnTheHouse. Key points included typical unit prices in the mid‑A$400k range, differing medians due to methodology/time windows, indicative rents (~A$450/week for units), estimated yields in the mid‑4% to high‑5% range, size-based medians (1‑bed ~A$310k, 2‑bed ~A$435k, 3‑bed ~A$651k), and recent growth figures (provider‑dependent). It explained why different platforms report different numbers and offered to pull live listings, recent sales, or run an investor yield calculation.\n\nWhen asked “what about rental costs?”, the assistant summarized current asking rents in Queanbeyan: approximate medians of A$460/week overall, ~A$600/week for houses, and ~A$450/week for units, with typical per‑bedroom unit rents (1‑bed ~A$370/week; 2‑bed ~A$450/week; 3‑bed ~A$620/week). It described common listing ranges (e.g., many 2‑bed units around A$430–A$520/week), provided caveats about differing data sources/timeframes, and offered further assistance such as exporting current rental listings, yield calculations, or a 30‑day trend.\n\nThe user’s final query asked for the driving distance from “4/99 Morton St Quenbyan” to “Quenbyan Public Library.” This introduced another misspelling (likely Queanbeyan) and awaited the assistant’s response."

Quick, practical ideas:\n\nFoundations\n- Ask what helps: “What would make this week easier for you?” and “Do you want comfort or solutions right now?”\n- Learn her preferences: note favorite coffee order, flowers, snacks, music, sizes, brands. Keep a shared or private note.\n- Own, don’t “help”: take full ownership of recurring tasks (e.g., groceries each week, car service, bill paying) so she doesn’t carry the mental load.\n\nDaily micro‑gestures\n- A specific compliment or thank‑you (what she did and why it mattered).\n- 10–15 minutes of undivided attention: phones away, just her agenda.\n- Small comforts: prep her water/tea, warm the car on cold days, set her side of the bed with a book light/charger.\n- Kind check‑ins: “Thinking of you—good luck with the 2 pm meeting.”\n\nReduce friction\n- Fix three tiny annoyances she mentions (squeaky door, slow laptop, cluttered entryway).\n- Preempt the next day: lay out breakfast items, pack the car, fill washer fluid, book the appointment she’s been postponing.\n\nQuality time\n- Plan a low‑effort date she’d pick: museum + bakery, hike + picnic, bookstore + coffee. Put it on the calendar, arrange logistics.\n- Create a no‑screens ritual: a walk after dinner, Sunday coffee, or midweek lunch.\n\nSupport her goals\n- Protect time for her hobby or workout; you cover everything else during that window.\n- Celebrate wins: small card or dessert when she hits milestones.\n\nWords and touch (if she likes them)\n- Short note on the mirror or in her bag.\n- Gentle touch as she passes; ask what kind of affection feels best and when.\n\nGifts, done thoughtfully\n- Replace something she uses daily with a nicer version, or restock her favorites.\n- Experiences over stuff: class together, day trip, or a surprise reservation she’s mentioned.\n\nWhen she’s stressed\n- Step in without asking: run bath, handle dinner, screen calls, tidy the space she needs.\n- Validate first: “That sounds exhausting; I can see why you’re upset.” Then ask if she wants help solving it.\n\nSimple 7‑day “be‑thoughtful” challenge\n- Day 1: Leave a note plus her favorite snack/drink.\n- Day 2: Take full ownership of one chore she dislikes (plan → do → clean up).\n- Day 3: 20‑minute no‑phone walk or couch chat focused on her day.\n- Day 4: Remove one nagging task from her list and report “handled.”\n- Day 5: Send a specific midday text about something she cares about.\n- Day 6: Plan and run a small date built around her interests.\n- Day 7: Ask, “What landed this week? What would you love more of next week?”\n\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\n- Keeping score or expecting praise.\n- Big gestures but inconsistent basics.\n- Asking “What can I do?” in the moment—anticipate and act.\n\nWant me to tailor a one‑week plan to her? Share a few details: her current stressors, what she enjoys (words, time together, acts of service, small gifts, touch), and your typical week."

Book dinner and breakfast now.\n- Personal touch: a framed throwback photo for the room and a handwritten note on the pillow.\n- Activity: something she’d pick—spa treatment, garden/museum visit, coastal drive, or a scenic hike + picnic.\n\n3) Memory walk + dinner (weekday-friendly)\n- After work Monday: sunset walk somewhere meaningful, then a reservation at her favorite place.\n- Gift: an antique or bone‑china tea for two; or a custom map print of a meaningful place (wedding/first home).\n- Dessert at home with a playlist from your years together.\n\nIf you want one special gift\n- Meaningful: upgrade something she uses daily (bag, robe, headphones) or an heirloom‑style locket with a tiny photo.\n- Experience: class together (pottery, cooking, dance), tickets to a show, or a “yes day” you plan around her favorites.\n- Personal: compile 36 notes from family/friends about what they admire about her.\n\nSimple timeline (so nothing slips)\n- Today (Aug 28): pick a plan and book the reservation/hotel; arrange childcare/pets if needed. Order flowers for delivery on Sep 8. Start a shared album to gather photos.\n- 3–5 days before: print one photo, write your 36 reasons, assemble a small gift. Confirm bookings, outfit, and transport.\n- Sep 8 morning (Mon): place a note where she’ll find it + her favorite coffee/snack.\n- Midday: have flowers or a small dessert delivered to her workplace/home with a short message.\n- Evening: your chosen plan (home dinner, special reservation, or memory walk), then a toast and a slow dance.\n\nWords you can use (short and real)\n- “Thirty-six years of choosing you. I still learn from you, I still laugh because of you, and I still can’t wait to see you walk into a room.”\n- “Thank you for the ordinary days we turned into a life.”\n\nBudget trims and upgrades\n- Trim: home-cooked version of her favorite restaurant dish; print photos at a local kiosk; flowers from a farmer’s market.\n- Upgrade: car service to dinner; private dining room; overnight suite with rose petals and late checkout.\n\nWant me to tailor this? Tell me:\n- Her top 2–3 likes (food, music, places), whether she prefers experiences, useful gifts, words, or touch, and your approximate budget.
