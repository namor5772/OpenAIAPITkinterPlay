no commercial advertising. Governed by the ABC Charter and Editorial Policies (accuracy, impartiality, independence).\n- Tone/audience: Speech‑led, specialist, long‑form. Smaller but highly engaged audience across academia, arts, policy, and the professions.\n\nHow to listen\n- Australia: AM transmitters nationwide (with DAB+ digital radio in capital cities). Exact AM frequencies vary by city (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Canberra, Darwin).\n- Worldwide: Stream live via the ABC Listen app or web player; most RN shows are also available as podcasts on ABC Listen, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.\n- Time zones: Live schedule follows Australian Eastern Time (AEST/AEDT); on‑demand podcasts are easiest for U.S.-based listeners.\n\nProgramming (what you’ll hear most)\n- News/current affairs and investigations: deep analysis and serial investigations.\n- Science/health/tech: researcher interviews, climate and space explainers, medical and bioethics coverage.\n- Ideas/philosophy/religion: debates on ethics and belief, intellectual history, philosophy roundtables.\n- Arts/culture/history: literature, screen, design/architecture, cultural history, festival recordings.\n- Law/economy/policy: consumer finance, law reform, regulation, geopolitics.\n- Documentary features: crafted, sound‑rich storytelling.\n\nRepresentative RN programs and feeds\n- Investigations/current affairs: Background Briefing; Rear Vision (history behind the headlines).\n- Science/tech/health: The Science Show; All in the Mind; (archived seasons of Science Friction).\n- Ideas/philosophy/religion: Big Ideas (lectures and forums); The Philosopher’s Zone; The Religion & Ethics Report.\n- Society/culture/history: Late Night Live; The History Listen; Earshot (documentary).\n- Law/economy: The Law Report; The Money; Future Tense (tech and society).\n\nHistory (selected milestones)\n- 1923–1924: Foundational stations 2FC (Sydney) and 3AR (Melbourne) begin broadcasting.\n- 1932: ABC established; these services become part of the national network.\n- Mid‑1980s: “Radio National” branding consolidates; now commonly “RN.”\n- 2000s–present: Strong on-demand and podcast presence; DAB+ digital rollout began in 2009.\n\nDeveloper/stream integration notes\n- Prefer official/public endpoints: ABC typically provides an official HLS/AAC live stream for RN via its platforms. Because endpoints and tokens sometimes change, it’s best to resolve and cache the current official URL rather than hard‑coding an old one.\n- Playback: HLS (AAC) is common; some regions may expose MP3/Icecast fallbacks. Many HLS radio streams do not carry ICY metadata; use schedule APIs/RSS for titles/artwork instead.\n- Metadata/artwork: Cache only what’s publicly provided (program titles, descriptions, show art) and respect ABC’s terms. Use ETag/Last‑Modified to avoid excessive requests.\n- Resilience: Implement timeouts, retries with backoff, and periodic re‑validation of the stream URL.\n\nExample: verify and play a live stream (placeholder URL)\n- Ask me to fetch and verify the current official RN stream URL for you; I’ll return a tested URL. Then you can plug it into this template.\n\nPython (requests + ffmpeg/ffplay installed)\n- Verifies reachability quickly, then hands off to ffplay for playback.

later absorbed into national service.\n- 1932: ABC established; national network develops from these foundational stations.\n- Post‑war decades: National AM “Radio 2” network evolves as a speech‑focused service.\n- Mid‑1980s: “Radio National” branding consolidates the network identity; later commonly “RN.”\n- 2000s–present: Early adopter of downloadable audio; strong podcast portfolio; DAB+ rollout (from 2009) in major cities.\n\nFunding, governance, and standards\n- ABC Board oversees corporate strategy; RN adheres to ABC Editorial Policies (impartiality, verification, fair treatment, corrections).\n- Complaints process and ombudsman mechanisms apply across ABC platforms, including RN.\n\nTechnology and distribution notes\n- AM transmission provides national reach, especially to regional/remote areas; DAB+ offers higher fidelity where available.\n- Most RN shows are podcasted, enabling time‑shifted listening; many series are evergreen and suitable for binge listening.\n\nNotable characteristics of style and production\n- Presenter‑led interviews, moderated panels, field reporting, and crafted documentaries.\n- Emphasis on context and expertise over breaking news; slower pace than ABC Local Radio.\n- Cross‑platform commissioning: many series are designed for both linear radio and on‑demand.\n\nGaps, unknowns, and things that change\n- Presenter line‑ups, program schedules, and individual show availability change periodically.\n- Some legacy shows are archived or seasonal; check the current feed for active series.\n\nAction items (optional)\n- Tell me your interests (e.g., science, investigations, philosophy, arts), and I’ll assemble a starter playlist of RN episodes.\n- If you want today’s (August 23, 2025) RN schedule, current presenters, or frequency details for a specific city, say the city and I’ll fetch the latest lineup and local tuning info."

      "content": "Here’s a clear, practical overview of ABC Radio National (RN), plus developer-friendly notes for streaming integration.\n\nWhat RN is\n- Network: ABC Radio National (often “RN”) is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s national ideas-and-culture network: in‑depth journalism, science, arts, society, philosophy, religion, history, and documentary features.\n- Funding/ads: Publicly funded; no commercial advertising. Governed by the ABC Charter and Editorial Policies (accuracy, impartiality, independence).\n- Tone/audience: Speech‑led, specialist, long‑form. Smaller but highly engaged audience across academia, arts, policy, and the professions.\n\nHow to listen\n- Australia: AM transmitters nationwide (with DAB+ digital radio in capital cities). Exact AM frequencies vary by city (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Canberra, Darwin).\n- Worldwide: Stream live via the ABC Listen app or web player; most RN shows are also available as podcasts on ABC Listen, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.\n- Time zones: Live schedule follows Australian Eastern Time (AEST/AEDT); on‑demand podcasts are easiest for U.S.-based listeners.\n\nProgramming (what you’ll hear most)\n- News/current affairs and investigations: deep analysis and serial investigations.\n- Science/health/tech: researcher interviews, climate and space explainers, medical and bioethics coverage.\n- Ideas/philosophy/religion: debates on ethics and belief, intellectual history, philosophy roundtables.\n- Arts/culture/history: literature, screen, design/architecture, cultural history, festival recordings.\n- Law/economy/policy: consumer finance, law reform, regulation, geopolitics.\n- Documentary features: crafted, sound‑rich storytelling.\n\nRepresentative RN programs and feeds\n- Investigations/current affairs: Background Briefing; Rear Vision (history behind the headlines).\n- Science/tech/health: The Science Show; All in the Mind; (archived seasons of Science Friction).\n- Ideas/philosophy/religion: Big Ideas (lectures and forums); The Philosopher’s Zone; The Religion & Ethics Report.\n- Society/culture/history: Late Night Live; The History Listen; Earshot (documentary).\n- Law/economy: The Law Report; The Money; Future Tense (tech and society).\n\nHistory (selected milestones)\n- 1923–1924: Foundational stations 2FC (Sydney) and 3AR (Melbourne) begin broadcasting.\n- 1932: ABC established; these services become part of the national network.\n- Mid‑1980s: “Radio National” branding consolidates; now commonly “RN.”\n- 2000s–present: Strong on-demand and podcast presence; DAB+ digital rollout began in 2009.\n\nDeveloper/stream integration notes\n- Prefer official/public endpoints: ABC typically provides an official HLS/AAC live stream for RN via its platforms. Because endpoints and tokens sometimes change, it’s best to resolve and cache the current official URL rather than hard‑coding an old one.\n- Playback: HLS (AAC) is common; some regions may expose MP3/Icecast fallbacks. Many HLS radio streams do not carry ICY metadata; use schedule APIs/RSS for titles/artwork instead.\n- Metadata/artwork: Cache only what’s publicly provided (program titles, descriptions, show art) and respect ABC’s terms. Use ETag/Last‑Modified to avoid excessive requests.\n- Resilience: Implement timeouts, retries with backoff, and periodic re‑validation of the stream URL.\n\nExample: verify and play a live stream (placeholder URL)\n- Ask me to fetch and verify the current official RN stream URL for you; I’ll return a tested URL. Then you can plug it into this template.\n\nPython (requests + ffmpeg/ffplay installed)\n- Verifies reachability quickly, then hands off to ffplay for playback. Adjust to your player stack as needed.\n\nimport subprocess, sys, time\nimport requests\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom urllib3.util.retry import Retry\n\nSTREAM_URL = \"https://example.com/abc-rn/live/playlist.m3u8\"  # Replace after I fetch the current official URL\n\ndef make_session(timeout=5):\n    s = requests.Session()\n    retries = Retry(\n        total=3, backoff_factor=0.8,\n        status_forcelist=(429, 500, 502, 503, 504),\n        allowed_methods=frozenset([\"GET\", \"HEAD\"])\n    )\n    s.mount(\"http://\", HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))\n    s.mount(\"https://\", HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))\n    s.headers.update({\"User-Agent\": \"RN-Player/1.0 (+contact@example.com)\"})\n    s.request = (lambda f: lambda *a, **k: f(*a, timeout=timeout, **k))(s.request)\n    return s\n\ndef verify_stream(url):\n    s = make_session()\n    # Try HEAD first;

use official public endpoints.\n\nWant me to fetch and verify, right now, the current official live stream URL for RN and today’s schedule (Saturday, August 23, 2025) in your time zone? If yes, I’ll look it up and return ready‑to‑use links."
