  "chat_display_plaintext": "— New chat started —\n\nYou: 92.02*16190/100\n\nBot: 14898.038\n\nYou: to 2dp\n\nBot: 14898.04\n\nYou: in $\n\nBot: $14898.04\n\nYou: with commas\n\nBot: $14,898.04\n\nYou: thanks\n\nBot: You’re welcome — try not to spend the $14,898.04 all in one place.\n\nYou: Its my BHP sahres hald year dividend in AUD\n\nBot: Nice — that’s $14,898.04 AUD as your BHP half‑year dividend.  \n\nWant me to convert it to another currency, calculate the dividend per share (give share count), estimate tax/franking‑credit effects (tell me your tax residency), or check whether a DRP was applied?\n\n\nYou: I Live near Binda NSW on 160 acres and have 4 small dams and one medum sized on of about 20m diameter. What creatures might live in these dams and how can i find that out?\n\nBot: Nice — congratulations, you own a small wetland empire. Here’s a concise, practical guide to what’s likely living in your dams near Binda, NSW and how you can find out for sure.\n\nLikely inhabitants (by group)\n- Fish: European carp, redfin (introduced), possibly small native galaxias, and/or mosquitofish (Gambusia) if introduced.  \n- Crustaceans: Yabbies (Cherax destructor) and small freshwater shrimp (e.g. Paratya spp.).  \n- Amphibians: Common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera), pobblebonk/banjo frog (Limnodynastes spp.), other local frogs calling at night.  \n- Reptiles: Eastern long‑necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) often in farm dams; water snakes such as tiger snakes and sometimes eastern brown snakes near water.  \n- Birds: Pacific black duck, Australian wood duck, herons (white‑faced heron), cormorants, ibis, and other waterbirds.  \n- Mammals: Rakali (water rat) possibly, bats feeding on insects, kangaroos/ wallabies on the banks. Platypus are unlikely in isolated, still farm dams (need flowing waterways).  \n- Aquatic invertebrates: Dragonfly and damselfly larvae, water beetles (Dytiscidae), mayfly and caddisfly larvae, snails and pond shrimp.  \n- Plants/algae: Native pondweeds, rushes, reeds and seasonal algal blooms.\n\nHow to find out — practical survey plan\n1. Visual daytime survey  \n   - Walk the shoreline and scan for birds, turtles, yabbies, fish surfacing, and vegetation. Look for tracks/latrines of rakali and signs of waterbird nesting.  \n2. Evening/night survey for frogs and mammals  \n   - Listen for frog calls at dusk/night. Use the FrogID app (Australian Museum) to record calls if you want ID help. Use a torch to spot eyeshine for frogs, turtles or rakali.  \n3. Simple sampling you can do yourself  \n   - Yabby traps/baited pots left overnight to detect yabby populations.  \n   - Dip net sweeping around emergent vegetation to catch macroinvertebrates, tadpoles and small fish.  \n   - A small seine or fyke net (if allowed) to sample fish — be careful with livestock and biosecurity.  \n4. Camera traps & spotlighting  \n   - Motion cameras on the bank aimed at likely crossing points will pick up mammals and nocturnal birds. Spotlighting at night will reveal frogs, possums, and snakes.  \n5. Professional / lab methods (for species you can’t ID)  \n   - eDNA sampling: water samples analysed in a lab can detect fish, amphibians, turtles and mammals from traces of DNA. Very effective for cryptic species.  \n   - Macroinvertebrate kick‑sampling and identification gives a quick read on water quality and biodiversity. Local consultants, Landcare or council can help.  \n6. Record keeping  \n   - Take geo‑tagged photos, short audio recordings of frog calls, and timestamps. Create a simple log of date/time/weather — hugely useful later.\n\nEquipment shortlist\n- Torch/headlamp, waterproof boots, binoculars, camera/phone, dip net, yabby traps, gloves, notebook or phone notes, motion camera (optional). For eDNA you just need to collect sterile bottles but better left to labs/consultants.\n\nSafety & biosecurity (don’t be the person who spreads carp)\n- Don’t wade barefoot; be snake‑aware (expect tiger or brown snakes).  \n- Clean and dry gear between dams to avoid spreading pest fish, yabbies or pathogens.  \n- Check NSW biosecurity rules before moving animals or stocking anything. Don’t introduce species to “improve” your dam without advice.\n\nWho to contact for help\n- Local Landcare group or the Upper Lachlan Shire Council environmental officer.  \n- NSW Department of Primary Industries (Fisheries) for fish/yabby advice.  \n- Australian Museum / FrogID for frog ID help.  \n- Local environmental consultants or uni students for eDNA, macroinvertebrate surveys or formal reports.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give a step‑by‑step weekend survey plan you can do yourself (one dam at a time), or  \n- Draft an email you can send to Landcare/DPI asking for help, or  \n- Explain how to collect eDNA samples and where to send them (I’ll look up local labs if you want).\n\nWhich would you like next?\n\n\n\nYou: gpt-5 has web search, what other models do?\n\nBot: Short answer: lots of modern LLMs can access the web — but they do it in different ways (built‑in browsing/tools, agentic “click/act” features, or via search-service integration). Below is a quick rundown of major players and how they handle web search/browsing.\n\n- OpenAI — GPT‑5 (and ChatGPT variants): GPT‑5’s developer announcement says it supports built‑in tools including web search; OpenAI also offers agentic features (Operator / Deep Research) that let models browse, interact with web pages and run multi‑step research. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Anthropic — Claude: Anthropic rolled out a web‑search feature for Claude so it can fetch and cite recent web information. ([anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Google — Gemini / Project Mariner / Agent Mode: Gemini’s ecosystem includes agentic/browser tools (Project Mariner / Agent Mode) that can browse, click, fill forms and perform multi‑step web tasks for subscribers. ([deepmind.google](https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-mariner/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Microsoft — Bing / Copilot: Microsoft’s Copilot (Bing) and Edge Copilot integrate web search and agentic actions (Copilot Search / Copilot Mode) so the assistant can return cited web results and perform web tasks. ([blogs.bing.com](https://blogs.bing.com/search/April-2025/Introducing-Copilot-Search-in-Bing?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Other services: Perplexity, xAI’s Grok and several search‑first products provide integrated web search/summarisation (some use backend LLMs like GPT/Gemini or their own models). Many open‑weight models (LLaMA family, custom on‑prem models) are offline by default and need retrieval plugins or a search API to get current web info.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Make a compact comparison table showing which models offer browsing, agent actions (click/submit), citation behaviour, API access and likely cost; or\n- Check a specific model/service for exact availability, pricing and how to enable browsing for developers/users (I’ll fetch current links). Which would you prefer?\n\nYou: I am asking specifically about OpenAI API models\n\nBot: Short answer, with fewer words and more accuracy than a politician: OpenAI API models don’t automatically “surf the web.” To get live web results you must use the Responses API’s built‑in web search tool (or the Chat/Completions “search‑preview” models). Here are the concrete details (current as of 26 August 2025).\n\n- Web search / browsing via the API is provided as a built‑in tool in the Responses API and is available for gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini (use the web_search_preview tool). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- The Chat/Completions API exposes dedicated search models named gpt-4o-search-preview and gpt-4o-mini-search-preview if you prefer that interface. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Web search in the API returns inline citations and is shipped in “preview” form to developers (pricing for the search preview models is published on the same page). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- The Responses API is OpenAI’s recommended primitive for combining models and tools (web search, file search, computer‑use, etc.) so the model can call tools during generation. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Support for tool usage has been extended beyond just gpt-4o: newer model families (GPT‑4.1 series and some o‑series models such as o3 / o4‑mini) can call tools in the Responses API per OpenAI’s tooling updates. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4-gpt-4-turbo-gpt-4o-and-gpt-4o-mini%3F.pls?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWhat this means for you practically:\n- If you call the API with, say, gpt-4o in a normal chat/completion call, it won’t fetch the web unless you invoke the web_search tool via the Responses API (or call the search‑preview models). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9824965-using-openai-o1-models-and-gpt-4o-models-on-chatgpt%23.iso?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWant a copy‑paste example? I can give you a minimal JavaScript or Python snippet showing a Responses API call that uses the web_search tool (and explain the response format and how the model returns citations). Which language do you want?\n\nYou: win python and gpt-4\n\nYou: with python and gpt4 i meant\n\nBot: Short answer: gpt-4 does not have a built‑in web_search tool in the Responses API — the built‑in web search is provided for the gpt‑4o family (and search‑preview models). If you want the model to fetch the web itself, use the Responses API with a web_search tool and a supported model (gpt‑4o). If you must use gpt‑4, fetch the web yourself (requests, BeautifulSoup, etc.) and pass the retrieved text to gpt‑4 as context. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nBelow are two minimal, practical Python examples.\n\n1) Recommended: Responses API + built‑in web search (use gpt‑4o and the web_search tool)\n- Uses the official OpenAI Python client (from openai import OpenAI).\n- The model may call the web_search tool and will return citations in the response. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n```python\n# pip install openai   # or the 'openai' package version that provides OpenAI()\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"])\n\nresp = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",                            # web_search is supported on gpt-4o/gpt-4o-mini\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"web_search_preview\"}],   # enable hosted web search tool\n    input=\"Summarise the latest public news about AI hardware and include source links.\"\n)\n\nprint(resp.output_text)  # human-friendly aggregated text; resp.output contains structured items & url citations\n```\n\n2) If you must use gpt‑4: perform the web query yourself, then give the fetched text to gpt‑4 as context\n- Useful when you need the gpt‑4 model specifically (no builtin tool).\n- You control which pages to include and how much to pass (beware token limits).\n\n```python\n# pip install requests openai\nimport os, requests\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"])\n\n# 1) fetch web content yourself (simple example)\nr = requests.get(\"https://example.com/some-article\")\narticle_text = r.text[:20000]  # truncate to stay within token limits\n\n# 2) send to gpt-4 as context\nresp = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    input=[\n        {\"role\":\"system\", \"content\":\"You are a concise summariser.\"},\n        {\"role\":\"user\", \"content\": f\"Summarise the article below and list the three most important points:\\n\\n{article_text}\"}\n    ],\n)\n\nprint(resp.output_text)\n```\n\nNotes and tips\n- Responses API with tools is the intended way to let the model call hosted tools (web_search/file_search). Use gpt‑4o or the search‑preview models for native web search. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- If you fetch pages yourself, chunk long pages and pass only the relevant excerpts to avoid hitting token limits.\n- Check the OpenAI docs and SDK version you’re using — the Python client API surface has changed recently; use the official examples for your SDK version. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWant me to:\n- give a fuller production‑grade example (pagination, async, error handling, retries), or\n- craft a snippet that captures and submits multiple URLs to the model and handles token trimming automatically?\n\nPick one and I’ll spit out the code — faster than you can say \"rate limit.\"\n\nBot: Nice and specific — finally. Short answer: gpt-4 (the classic gpt-4 model) does not have a built‑in web_search tool available in the Responses API. OpenAI exposes web search as a built‑in tool in the Responses API for the gpt-4o / gpt-4o-mini (and search‑preview models); if you want automatic web calls + inline citations you must use those tool‑enabled models or use the Responses API tool path. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nTwo practical ways to get live web results from Python while still using GPT-4 behaviourally:\n\n1) Use OpenAI’s Responses API web_search (recommended if you’re okay using gpt-4o or a search‑preview model)\n- Pros: model calls web and returns inline citations automatically; minimal plumbing for you.  \n- Cons: uses gpt-4o / search‑preview models (not classic gpt-4) and the feature is a preview/paid tool. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nMinimal Python snippet (Responses API + web_search_preview):\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nresponse = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"web_search_preview\"}],\n    input=\"Summarise the latest news about BHP and include source links.\"\n)\n\nprint(response.output_text)\n\n(That is the cookbook/example pattern shown in OpenAI docs). ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n2) If you must use classic gpt-4: do the search yourself, then pass the search results into gpt-4 (Retrieval‑Augmented prompt)\n- Pros: you keep using gpt-4 exactly, choose any search provider (Bing, SerpAPI, Google CSE, etc.).  \n- Cons: you must call an external search API and paginate/format results yourself; the model won’t generate live citations unless you instruct it to cite the provided results.\n\nPattern (abstract example):\n- fetch_search_results(query) → list of {title, snippet, url}\n- build a short numbered block of results\n- send to gpt-4 in messages with a system instruction to \"answer using only the numbered results and cite results by number\"\n\nMinimal Python sketch:\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n# assume fetch_search_results(query) returns [{'title':..., 'snippet':..., 'url':...}, ...]\nresults = fetch_search_results(\"BHP dividend 2025\")\nresults_text = \"\\n\\n\".join(f\"{i+1}. {r['title']}\\n{r['snippet']}\\n{r['url']}\" for i,r in enumerate(results))\n\nprompt = f\"Use only the information in the numbered search results below. Cite results by number in your answer.\\n\\n{results_text}\\n\\nQuestion: Summarise the payout and sources.\"\n\nresp = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\":\"system\", \"content\":\"You are a cautious assistant. Use ONLY the numbered results; cite each factual claim by result number.\"},\n        {\"role\":\"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ],\n    temperature=0\n)\n\nprint(resp.choices[0].message.content)\n\nNotes and caveats\n- The Responses API web_search tool is in preview and intended to be used with gpt-4o / gpt-4o-mini or search‑preview models; the cookbook shows the exact pattern. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- If you go the manual route, any search provider will do — and you control freshness and location bias.  \n- If you want a fully working example I can provide:\n  - a ready‑to‑run sample that uses SerpAPI (or Bing Web Search) + gpt-4 prompt wiring, or  \n  - a complete Responses API example using Python + gpt-4o with extra options (search_context_size, user_location) pulled from the docs.\n\nWhich do you want: (A) Responses API example (gpt-4o + web_search_preview), or (B) full working gpt-4 + SerpAPI/Bing example you can run locally?\n\nYou: is the same code ok for gpt-5\n\nBot: Short answer: yes — mostly. But you’ll need to swap the model name and (possibly) the tool name, and upgrade the OpenAI Python SDK so the new GPT‑5 parameters and tool interfaces are recognised.\n\nWhat to change\n- Model: replace \"gpt-4\" / \"gpt-4o\" with \"gpt-5\" (or \"gpt-5-mini\"/\"gpt-5-nano\" as appropriate). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Use the Responses API + built‑in tools for automatic web search (that’s the recommended path). GPT‑5 supports the Responses API and built‑in tools (web search, file search, custom tools). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Tool name: the cookbook/examples show the web search tool as \"web_search\" (some docs/examples also use \"web_search_preview\" for earlier preview models). If your SDK complains, try \"web_search\" first, and if that fails try \"web_search_preview\". Upgrade the SDK if you see unknown-parameter errors. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- New GPT‑5 params: you can also pass verbosity and reasoning_effort options if you want finer control. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nMinimal Python example (Responses API + web search)\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()  # ensure your openai package is up to date\n\nresponse = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-5\",\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"web_search\"}],   # or \"web_search_preview\" if your SDK/docs require it\n    input=\"Summarise the latest news about BHP and include source links.\",\n)\n\nprint(response.output_text)\n\nIf you absolutely must keep doing manual search + gpt-5 (the old retrieval-augmented approach), that still works — just fetch the pages yourself (requests / SerpAPI / Bing), trim to token limits and pass the text into the model. That gives you full control of sources but costs more plumbing. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nPractical checklist before you run it\n- pip install --upgrade openai (use the latest SDK that matches the platform docs). ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Test which tool string your SDK expects (\"web_search\" vs \"web_search_preview\"). Community threads show mismatches when SDKs are out of date. ([community.openai.com](https://community.openai.com/t/is-the-new-web-search-parameter-working/1141371?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Consider using verbosity/reasoning_effort if you want shorter or faster answers. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWant me to paste a production‑grade example (error handling, streaming, token trimming) for gpt-5? I’ll do it — because apparently you like working hard.\n\n\n\n\n",

Here’s a concise, practical guide to what’s likely living in your dams near Binda, NSW and how you can find out for sure.\n\nLikely inhabitants (by group)\n- Fish: European carp, redfin (introduced), possibly small native galaxias, and/or mosquitofish (Gambusia) if introduced.  \n- Crustaceans: Yabbies (Cherax destructor) and small freshwater shrimp (e.g. Paratya spp.).  \n- Amphibians: Common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera), pobblebonk/banjo frog (Limnodynastes spp.), other local frogs calling at night.  \n- Reptiles: Eastern long‑necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) often in farm dams; water snakes such as tiger snakes and sometimes eastern brown snakes near water.  \n- Birds: Pacific black duck, Australian wood duck, herons (white‑faced heron), cormorants, ibis, and other waterbirds.  \n- Mammals: Rakali (water rat) possibly, bats feeding on insects, kangaroos/ wallabies on the banks. Platypus are unlikely in isolated, still farm dams (need flowing waterways).  \n- Aquatic invertebrates: Dragonfly and damselfly larvae, water beetles (Dytiscidae), mayfly and caddisfly larvae, snails and pond shrimp.  \n- Plants/algae: Native pondweeds, rushes, reeds and seasonal algal blooms.\n\nHow to find out — practical survey plan\n1. Visual daytime survey  \n   - Walk the shoreline and scan for birds, turtles, yabbies, fish surfacing, and vegetation. Look for tracks/latrines of rakali and signs of waterbird nesting.  \n2. Evening/night survey for frogs and mammals  \n   - Listen for frog calls at dusk/night. Use the FrogID app (Australian Museum) to record calls if you want ID help. Use a torch to spot eyeshine for frogs, turtles or rakali.  \n3. Simple sampling you can do yourself  \n   - Yabby traps/baited pots left overnight to detect yabby populations.  \n   - Dip net sweeping around emergent vegetation to catch macroinvertebrates, tadpoles and small fish.  \n   - A small seine or fyke net (if allowed) to sample fish — be careful with livestock and biosecurity.  \n4. Camera traps & spotlighting  \n   - Motion cameras on the bank aimed at likely crossing points will pick up mammals and nocturnal birds. Spotlighting at night will reveal frogs, possums, and snakes.  \n5. Professional / lab methods (for species you can’t ID)  \n   - eDNA sampling: water samples analysed in a lab can detect fish, amphibians, turtles and mammals from traces of DNA. Very effective for cryptic species.  \n   - Macroinvertebrate kick‑sampling and identification gives a quick read on water quality and biodiversity. Local consultants, Landcare or council can help.  \n6. Record keeping  \n   - Take geo‑tagged photos, short audio recordings of frog calls, and timestamps. Create a simple log of date/time/weather — hugely useful later.\n\nEquipment shortlist\n- Torch/headlamp, waterproof boots, binoculars, camera/phone, dip net, yabby traps, gloves, notebook or phone notes, motion camera (optional). For eDNA you just need to collect sterile bottles but better left to labs/consultants.\n\nSafety & biosecurity (don’t be the person who spreads carp)\n- Don’t wade barefoot; be snake‑aware (expect tiger or brown snakes).  \n- Clean and dry gear between dams to avoid spreading pest fish, yabbies or pathogens.  \n- Check NSW biosecurity rules before moving animals or stocking anything. Don’t introduce species to “improve” your dam without advice.\n\nWho to contact for help\n- Local Landcare group or the Upper Lachlan Shire Council environmental officer.  \n- NSW Department of Primary Industries (Fisheries) for fish/yabby advice.  \n- Australian Museum / FrogID for frog ID help.  \n- Local environmental consultants or uni students for eDNA, macroinvertebrate surveys or formal reports.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give a step‑by‑step weekend survey plan you can do yourself (one dam at a time), or  \n- Draft an email you can send to Landcare/DPI asking for help, or  \n- Explain how to collect eDNA samples and where to send them (I’ll look up local labs if you want).\n\nWhich would you like next?"

Below is a quick rundown of major players and how they handle web search/browsing.\n\n- OpenAI — GPT‑5 (and ChatGPT variants): GPT‑5’s developer announcement says it supports built‑in tools including web search; OpenAI also offers agentic features (Operator / Deep Research) that let models browse, interact with web pages and run multi‑step research. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Anthropic — Claude: Anthropic rolled out a web‑search feature for Claude so it can fetch and cite recent web information. ([anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Google — Gemini / Project Mariner / Agent Mode: Gemini’s ecosystem includes agentic/browser tools (Project Mariner / Agent Mode) that can browse, click, fill forms and perform multi‑step web tasks for subscribers. ([deepmind.google](https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-mariner/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Microsoft — Bing / Copilot: Microsoft’s Copilot (Bing) and Edge Copilot integrate web search and agentic actions (Copilot Search / Copilot Mode) so the assistant can return cited web results and perform web tasks. ([blogs.bing.com](https://blogs.bing.com/search/April-2025/Introducing-Copilot-Search-in-Bing?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n- Other services: Perplexity, xAI’s Grok and several search‑first products provide integrated web search/summarisation (some use backend LLMs like GPT/Gemini or their own models). Many open‑weight models (LLaMA family, custom on‑prem models) are offline by default and need retrieval plugins or a search API to get current web info.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Make a compact comparison table showing which models offer browsing, agent actions (click/submit), citation behaviour, API access and likely cost; or\n- Check a specific model/service for exact availability, pricing and how to enable browsing for developers/users (I’ll fetch current links). Which would you prefer?"

      "content": "Short answer, with fewer words and more accuracy than a politician: OpenAI API models don’t automatically “surf the web.” To get live web results you must use the Responses API’s built‑in web search tool (or the Chat/Completions “search‑preview” models). Here are the concrete details (current as of 26 August 2025).\n\n- Web search / browsing via the API is provided as a built‑in tool in the Responses API and is available for gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini (use the web_search_preview tool). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- The Chat/Completions API exposes dedicated search models named gpt-4o-search-preview and gpt-4o-mini-search-preview if you prefer that interface. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Web search in the API returns inline citations and is shipped in “preview” form to developers (pricing for the search preview models is published on the same page). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- The Responses API is OpenAI’s recommended primitive for combining models and tools (web search, file search, computer‑use, etc.) so the model can call tools during generation. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Support for tool usage has been extended beyond just gpt-4o: newer model families (GPT‑4.1 series and some o‑series models such as o3 / o4‑mini) can call tools in the Responses API per OpenAI’s tooling updates. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4-gpt-4-turbo-gpt-4o-and-gpt-4o-mini%3F.pls?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWhat this means for you practically:\n- If you call the API with, say, gpt-4o in a normal chat/completion call, it won’t fetch the web unless you invoke the web_search tool via the Responses API (or call the search‑preview models). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9824965-using-openai-o1-models-and-gpt-4o-models-on-chatgpt%23.iso?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWant a copy‑paste example? I can give you a minimal JavaScript or Python snippet showing a Responses API call that uses the web_search tool (and explain the response format and how the model returns citations).

Use gpt‑4o or the search‑preview models for native web search. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- If you fetch pages yourself, chunk long pages and pass only the relevant excerpts to avoid hitting token limits.\n- Check the OpenAI docs and SDK version you’re using — the Python client API surface has changed recently; use the official examples for your SDK version. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/responses_example?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nWant me to:\n- give a fuller production‑grade example (pagination, async, error handling, retries), or\n- craft a snippet that captures and submits multiple URLs to the model and handles token trimming automatically?\n\nPick one and I’ll spit out the code — faster than you can say \"rate limit.\""

But you’ll need to swap the model name and (possibly) the tool name, and upgrade the OpenAI Python SDK so the new GPT‑5 parameters and tool interfaces are recognised.\n\nWhat to change\n- Model: replace \"gpt-4\" / \"gpt-4o\" with \"gpt-5\" (or \"gpt-5-mini\"/\"gpt-5-nano\" as appropriate). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Use the Responses API + built‑in tools for automatic web search (that’s the recommended path). GPT‑5 supports the Responses API and built‑in tools (web search, file search, custom tools).

If your SDK complains, try \"web_search\" first, and if that fails try \"web_search_preview\". Upgrade the SDK if you see unknown-parameter errors.

That gives you full control of sources but costs more plumbing.

([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Test which tool string your SDK expects (\"web_search\" vs \"web_search_preview\").

([community.openai.com](https://community.openai.com/t/is-the-new-web-search-parameter-working/1141371?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  \n- Consider using verbosity/reasoning_effort if you want shorter or faster answers.
