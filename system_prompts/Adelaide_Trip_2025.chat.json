Quick check: did you mean Fairview Park (with an “i” after the a), the suburb in Tea Tree Gully?\n\nHow can I help with the place?

Here’s a five‑day, low‑stress Adelaide + surrounds plan built from Fairview Park with short drives, good food, wildlife, wine and coast. Swap days around as needed (see notes).\n\nQuick date note: if your visit includes Sunday 5 October 2025, SA moves to daylight saving overnight (clocks forward 1 hour). NSW does the same, so the Sydney–Adelaide difference stays 30 minutes.

Hills hikes are optional.\n- Booking list (do these 1–2 weeks ahead):\n  - Seppeltsfield tasting and lunch. ([seppeltsfield.com.au](https://seppeltsfield.com.au/tour-discover-2/daily-tours-tastings/?utm_source=openai))\n  - Cleland koala experience (if upgrading).

Freeway to the Hills is easy; Barossa via Gawler is straightforward.\n- Weather: Early October = spring—layers, hat, and a light rain shell.

Tell me:\n- Exact dates and arrival/departure times.\n- Any mobility or dietary needs.\n- Wine enthusiasm level (none / light tastings / keen but with a driver).  \n\nI’ll tighten times, place bookings, and drop you a neat day‑by‑day with maps and drive notes.\n\nSources:\n  1. https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/australia/adelaide?utm_source=openai\n  2. https://adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/trading-hours/?utm_source=openai\n  3. https://www.agsa.sa.gov.au/?utm_source=openai\n  4. https://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/visit/plan-your-visit?utm_source=openai\n  5. https://www.botanicgardens.sa.gov.au/?utm_source=openai\n  6. https://thepopeye.com.au/cruises/?utm_source=openai\n  7. https://www.clelandwildlifepark.sa.gov.au/cleland-experiences/koala-experiences/koala-close-up?utm_source=openai\n  8. https://seppeltsfield.com.au/contacts-hours-locations/?utm_source=openai\n  9. https://farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au/visit-us?utm_source=openai\n  10. https://maritime.history.sa.gov.au/visit/?utm_source=openai\n  11. https://nrm.org.au/?utm_source=openai\n  12. https://portrivercruises.com.au/our-tours?utm_source=openai\n  13. https://horsedrawntram.com.au/home/timetable/?utm_source=openai\n  14. https://seppeltsfield.com.au/tour-discover-2/daily-tours-tastings/?utm_source=openai\n  15. https://www.clelandwildlifepark.sa.gov.au/cleland-experiences/koala-experiences/hold-a-koala?utm_source=openai\n\n\n\n\n\nYou: hi\n\nBot: Hey—Jason “Planky” Hardiplank here. How can I help next?\n\nIf you want me to lock in that 5‑day Adelaide plan, just tell me:\n- The exact dates (e.g., Oct 3–7, 2025) and their flight times.\n- Any mobility or dietary needs.\n- Wine interest level (none, light tastings, or keen—with a designated driver).\n\nI’ll turn it into a precise, printable day‑by‑day with bookings pencilled.\n\nYou: Tell me about Maggie Beers place near adelaide, distance from 4 Soutchack street, time to get there tommorow\n\nBot: Got it. You mean Maggie Beer’s Farm Shop at the Pheasant Farm in the Barossa.\n\nAbout the place\n- What it is: Maggie Beer’s original farm shop with tastings of her products, Pheasant Farm Wines, light bites/coffee by the lake, and bookable experiences (e.g., tastings, demos). The Farm Eatery next door does lunch. Open 7 days, typically 10:00–4:30. Address: 50 Pheasant Farm Road (via Samuel Rd), Nuriootpa SA 5355. Phone: (08) 8562 4477. ([farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au](https://farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au/visit-us?utm_source=openai))\n\nFrom your place to Maggie Beer’s\n- I’m assuming your address is 4 Soutchak Street, Fairview Park SA 5126 (note spelling “Soutchak”). If that’s right, the drive is roughly 55–60 km via Hancock Rd → North East Rd → A20 (Sturt Hwy), then left into Pheasant Farm Rd. Expect about 50–60 minutes in normal traffic. For reference, Adelaide–Nuriootpa is ~77–86 km and ~50–60 minutes depending on route/traffic. ([street-directory.ozpostcode.com](https://street-directory.ozpostcode.com/address/sa/161905/4-soutchak-street-fairview-park-sa-5126?utm_source=openai))\n\nTiming for tomorrow\n- Tomorrow in SA is Thursday, 2 October 2025. If you leave around 9:15–9:30 am you’ll roll in close to opening (10:00 am), miss peak commuter traffic, and have time for a relaxed tasting/coffee before lunch. Hours are 10:00–4:30, so an easy half‑day fits well. ([farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au](https://farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au/visit-us?utm_source=openai))\n\nTips\n- Book lunch at The Farm Eatery if you want a sit‑down meal; it can fill up. Consider the wine + cheeseboard tasting for two. ([maggiebeersfarmshop.com.au](https://www.maggiebeersfarmshop.com.au/indulgent?utm_source=openai))\n\nWant me to firm this up with turn‑by‑turn directions from 4 Soutchak St and a best‑arrival window based on live traffic tomorrow morning?\n\n\nYou: Tell me about visiting Hallet cove\n\nBot: Great pick—and it’s “Hallett Cove” with two t’s. It’s one of Adelaide’s best short coastal outings: dramatic cliffs, unique geology, and a photogenic boardwalk.\n\nWhat it is\n- Hallett Cove Conservation Park: protected coastal cliffs with the Sugarloaf (striped sand-clay formation), Black Cliff Lookout, Amphitheatre, and 280‑million‑year‑old glacial pavements.\n- Marion Coastal Walk/Boardwalk: timber boardwalk with lots of stairs between Hallett Cove and Marino Rocks; big sea views.\n\nHighlights\n- Sugarloaf lookout and Amphitheatre loop for classic photos.\n- Glacial Pavements (short spur inland from the foreshore).\n- Boardwalk section toward Marino Rocks for the best cliff‑top vistas.\n- Dolphins are fairly common; in winter–spring you can occasionally spot whales offshore.\n\nHow long and how hard\n- Easy scenic potter: 45–75 minutes around the Sugarloaf/foreshore lookouts with plenty of stops.\n- Moderate walk: 2–3 hours return Hallett Cove ↔ Marino Rocks on the boardwalk (many stairs; good handrails).\n- Surfaces: mostly boardwalk/stairs; some compacted dirt in the park. Not wheelchair‑friendly along the boardwalk; the foreshore paths are flatter.\n\nGetting there from Fairview Park (4 Soutchak St)\n- Drive: about 50–60 km, typically 55–70 minutes each way. Fastest is usually North–South Motorway southbound, then Southern Expressway toward Hallett Cove.\n- Best parking: Heron Way Reserve (by the Boatshed Café) for the boardwalk and Sugarloaf; there’s also parking near Hallett Cove Beach railway station if you’re doing a one‑way walk.\n\nPracticalities\n- Hours/fees: Park is free; effectively sunrise to sunset.\n- Facilities: Toilets, café and water at the foreshore/Heron Way Reserve; none deep in the park.\n- Dogs: Not permitted inside the Conservation Park (strict). OK on some nearby coastal paths—follow signage.\n- Safety: Lots of stairs; can be windy. Steps get slippery after rain. Stay behind fences—cliff edges are unstable.\n\nBest time to visit\n- Morning or late afternoon for softer light and less wind. Spring (your timing) is ideal—wildflowers and mild temps.\n\nSimple half‑day plan\n- Arrive Heron Way ~9:30.\n- Do the Sugarloaf/Amphitheatre lookouts first (45–60 min at an easy pace).\n- Optional: continue partway toward Marino Rocks (turn around whenever you’ve had your fill of stairs/views).\n- Coffee or lunch at the Boatshed Café on return; head back via Brighton/Seacliff if you want a flat beach stroll.\n\nWant me to pin this to a specific day with ideal arrival window based on forecast and tide, plus a printable map and step counts?\n\nYou: printable map please\n\nBot: Got you a clean, print-ready map set for Hallett Cove. Pick one (or print both):\n\n- City of Marion Coastal Walks map (best for the boardwalk + Sugarloaf/Geology Circuit)\n  - One-page PDF showing trailheads, lookouts, toilets, cafes and the “Geology Circuit” in the park.\n  - Print tips: A4, landscape, fit-to-page on, color if possible.\n  - Source: City of Marion brochure PDF.

([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Pickett?utm_source=openai))\n- Paul Petts — English footballer (Shrewsbury Town, Bristol Rovers), died March 24, 2025. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Petts?utm_source=openai))\n- Lenny Potts — U.S. skydiving Hall of Fame inductee (note different surname). ([skydivingmuseum.org](https://skydivingmuseum.org/hall-of-fame/inductee/lenny-potts?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf none of those, give me one clue (what he does, where he’s based, approximate age, or a link) and I’ll pull the right info fast.\n\nYou: Used to work for Channel ( in Sydney, late 60's age?\n\nBot: Got it. I can’t match “Lenny Petts” to a public TV profile yet. Quick clarifier so I pull the right person:\n- Which channel in Sydney: 7, 9, 10, ABC or SBS?\n- Role: on‑air (presenter/reporter) or crew (camera, sound, floor manager, producer)?\n- Spelling check: Petts, Pett, Pitts, Petz, or something similar?\n- Any show/program he worked on?\n\nGive me two of those and I’ll find him and send you a neat one‑paragraph bio with current whereabouts if available.\n\nYou: Channel 9, he worked behind the scenes\n\nBot: Thanks—that narrows it.\n\nLikeliest match\n- Leonard (“Lenny”) Petts appears in public staff listings for Nine Network Australia as an Avid Administrator based in Sydney—i.e., a behind‑the‑scenes post‑production/technology role. ([personlookup.com.au](https://personlookup.com.au/c/nine-network-australia/5?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhat that job usually does at Nine\n- Keeps the Avid editing environment humming (Media Composer workstations, MediaCentral, NEXIS shared storage), supports editors/news, manages ingest/outgest and user permissions, and liaises with vendors/integrators. Nine’s Sydney HQ runs a large Avid-based workflow, so this fits your “Channel 9, behind the scenes” description. ([qvest.com](https://www.qvest.com/en/spotlight/nine-network/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAge/status\n- I can’t find a public bio with his age or personal details; nothing credible to confirm “late‑60s.” If you’re after a reconnection rather than a profile, I can try targeted outreach.\n\nWant me to track him down?\n- I can do a deeper check (public records, industry groups, recent credits) or place a discreet enquiry via Nine’s main switchboard to Post Production/Technology. Tell me if you want me to proceed and whether you prefer me to ask for a callback or just confirm whether he’s currently there.\n\n\n",

([clelandwildlifepark.sa.gov.au](https://www.clelandwildlifepark.sa.gov.au/cleland-experiences/koala-experiences/koala-close-up?utm_source=openai))\n- Hahndorf for lunch and a stroll (German village main street, galleries, bakeries).\n- Return via Stirling for a coffee. Driving: ~40–50 min each way from Fairview Park, short hops between stops.\n\nDay 3 – Barossa Valley day (sip, don’t slog)\n- Seppeltsfield estate tasting (pre‑book; cellar door 10:30–5:00 daily). Consider the Centennial Cellar experience if you’re keen. Lunch option: Fino at Seppeltsfield. ([seppeltsfield.com.au](https://seppeltsfield.com.au/contacts-hours-locations/?utm_source=openai))\n- Maggie Beer’s Farm Shop for a gentle stroll, tastings and coffee (open 10:00–4:30 daily). ([farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au](https://farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au/visit-us?utm_source=openai))\n- Add one smaller cellar door (e.g., along Seppeltsfield Rd) if energy allows.\n- Mengler Hill Lookout photo stop.\n- Driving: ~55 min Fairview Park → Seppeltsfield; short drives between venues. Tip: pick a designated driver or use spittoons.\n\nDay 4 – Coast + Port Adelaide (history or dolphins)\n- Morning at Glenelg: jetty walk, beach air, easy shopping on Jetty Rd.\n- Afternoon in Port Adelaide—choose one:\n  - South Australian Maritime Museum (open daily 10–5; flat, lift access). ([maritime.history.sa.gov.au](https://maritime.history.sa.gov.au/visit/?utm_source=openai))\n  - National Railway Museum (open daily 10–5; lots of shade/seating). ([nrm.org.au](https://nrm.org.au/?utm_source=openai))\n  - Port River Dolphin & Ships Graveyard cruise (90 min; multiple departures most days). ([portrivercruises.com.au](https://portrivercruises.com.au/our-tours?utm_source=openai))\n- Driving: Fairview Park → Glenelg ~50–55 min; Glenelg → Port Adelaide ~35 min; Port Adelaide → home ~40 min.\n\nDay 5 – Fleurieu Peninsula (scenic coast day)\n- Victor Harbor: stroll the Causeway or ride the historic Horse‑Drawn Tram to Granite Island (first tram ~10:30; runs about every 40 min; weather/horse dependent). ([horsedrawntram.com.au](https://horsedrawntram.com.au/home/timetable/?utm_source=openai))\n- Light lap of Granite Island boardwalks; lookouts galore. Lunch in Victor Harbor or at nearby Port Elliot (Horseshoe Bay) or Goolwa by the river.\n- Optional return via McLaren Vale for a single tasting or a look at the d’Arenberg Cube (if you’ve still got wine left in you).\n- Driving: Fairview Park → Victor Harbor ~1 hr 40 min each way; add ~15–20 min if detouring via McLaren Vale.\n\nPractical notes (so the week runs smooth)\n- Market days: If your Day 1 lands on Sun/Mon, swap it with another day so you hit Central Market Tue–Sat (Friday evening is liveliest). ([adelaidecentralmarket.com.au](https://adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/trading-hours/?utm_source=openai))\n- Gentle pacing: I’ve kept walking low/moderate with frequent seated options (museums, cruises, cellar doors). Hills hikes are optional.\n- Booking list (do these 1–2 weeks ahead):\n  - Seppeltsfield tasting and lunch. ([seppeltsfield.com.au](https://seppeltsfield.com.au/tour-discover-2/daily-tours-tastings/?utm_source=openai))\n  - Cleland koala experience (if upgrading). ([clelandwildlifepark.sa.gov.au](https://www.clelandwildlifepark.sa.gov.au/cleland-experiences/koala-experiences/hold-a-koala?utm_source=openai))\n  - Popeye cruise (if weekends or school holidays). ([thepopeye.com.au](https://thepopeye.com.au/cruises/?utm_source=openai))\n  - Port River cruise (pick a time that suits your museum plans). ([portrivercruises.com.au](https://portrivercruises.com.au/our-tours?utm_source=openai))\n- Driving times: Adelaide traffic is kind; plan 30–60 min legs. Freeway to the Hills is easy; Barossa via Gawler is straightforward.\n- Weather: Early October = spring—layers, hat, and a light rain shell. If it’s wet, swap Day 5 (Fleurieu) with Day 4 (museums/cruise).\n\nWant me to lock this to your exact dates and flight times, plus pencil the bookings? Tell me:\n- Exact dates and arrival/departure times.\n- Any mobility or dietary needs.\n- Wine enthusiasm level (none / light tastings / keen but with a driver).  \n\nI’ll tighten times, place bookings, and drop you a neat day‑by‑day with maps and drive notes."

You mean Maggie Beer’s Farm Shop at the Pheasant Farm in the Barossa.\n\nAbout the place\n- What it is: Maggie Beer’s original farm shop with tastings of her products, Pheasant Farm Wines, light bites/coffee by the lake, and bookable experiences (e.g., tastings, demos). The Farm Eatery next door does lunch. Open 7 days, typically 10:00–4:30. Address: 50 Pheasant Farm Road (via Samuel Rd), Nuriootpa SA 5355. Phone: (08) 8562 4477. ([farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au](https://farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au/visit-us?utm_source=openai))\n\nFrom your place to Maggie Beer’s\n- I’m assuming your address is 4 Soutchak Street, Fairview Park SA 5126 (note spelling “Soutchak”). If that’s right, the drive is roughly 55–60 km via Hancock Rd → North East Rd → A20 (Sturt Hwy), then left into Pheasant Farm Rd. Expect about 50–60 minutes in normal traffic. For reference, Adelaide–Nuriootpa is ~77–86 km and ~50–60 minutes depending on route/traffic. ([street-directory.ozpostcode.com](https://street-directory.ozpostcode.com/address/sa/161905/4-soutchak-street-fairview-park-sa-5126?utm_source=openai))\n\nTiming for tomorrow\n- Tomorrow in SA is Thursday, 2 October 2025. If you leave around 9:15–9:30 am you’ll roll in close to opening (10:00 am), miss peak commuter traffic, and have time for a relaxed tasting/coffee before lunch. Hours are 10:00–4:30, so an easy half‑day fits well. ([farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au](https://farm-shop.maggiebeer.com.au/visit-us?utm_source=openai))\n\nTips\n- Book lunch at The Farm Eatery if you want a sit‑down meal; it can fill up. Consider the wine + cheeseboard tasting for two. ([maggiebeersfarmshop.com.au](https://www.maggiebeersfarmshop.com.au/indulgent?utm_source=openai))\n\nWant me to firm this up with turn‑by‑turn directions from 4 Soutchak St and a best‑arrival window based on live traffic tomorrow morning?"

      "content": "Great pick—and it’s “Hallett Cove” with two t’s. It’s one of Adelaide’s best short coastal outings: dramatic cliffs, unique geology, and a photogenic boardwalk.\n\nWhat it is\n- Hallett Cove Conservation Park: protected coastal cliffs with the Sugarloaf (striped sand-clay formation), Black Cliff Lookout, Amphitheatre, and 280‑million‑year‑old glacial pavements.\n- Marion Coastal Walk/Boardwalk: timber boardwalk with lots of stairs between Hallett Cove and Marino Rocks; big sea views.\n\nHighlights\n- Sugarloaf lookout and Amphitheatre loop for classic photos.\n- Glacial Pavements (short spur inland from the foreshore).\n- Boardwalk section toward Marino Rocks for the best cliff‑top vistas.\n- Dolphins are fairly common; in winter–spring you can occasionally spot whales offshore.\n\nHow long and how hard\n- Easy scenic potter: 45–75 minutes around the Sugarloaf/foreshore lookouts with plenty of stops.\n- Moderate walk: 2–3 hours return Hallett Cove ↔ Marino Rocks on the boardwalk (many stairs; good handrails).\n- Surfaces: mostly boardwalk/stairs; some compacted dirt in the park. Not wheelchair‑friendly along the boardwalk; the foreshore paths are flatter.\n\nGetting there from Fairview Park (4 Soutchak St)\n- Drive: about 50–60 km, typically 55–70 minutes each way. Fastest is usually North–South Motorway southbound, then Southern Expressway toward Hallett Cove.\n- Best parking: Heron Way Reserve (by the Boatshed Café) for the boardwalk and Sugarloaf; there’s also parking near Hallett Cove Beach railway station if you’re doing a one‑way walk.\n\nPracticalities\n- Hours/fees: Park is free; effectively sunrise to sunset.\n- Facilities: Toilets, café and water at the foreshore/Heron Way Reserve; none deep in the park.\n- Dogs: Not permitted inside the Conservation Park (strict). OK on some nearby coastal paths—follow signage.\n- Safety: Lots of stairs; can be windy. Steps get slippery after rain. Stay behind fences—cliff edges are unstable.\n\nBest time to visit\n- Morning or late afternoon for softer light and less wind. Spring (your timing) is ideal—wildflowers and mild temps.\n\nSimple half‑day plan\n- Arrive Heron Way ~9:30.\n- Do the Sugarloaf/Amphitheatre lookouts first (45–60 min at an easy pace).\n- Optional: continue partway toward Marino Rocks (turn around whenever you’ve had your fill of stairs/views).\n- Coffee or lunch at the Boatshed Café on return; head back via Brighton/Seacliff if you want a flat beach stroll.\n\nWant me to pin this to a specific day with ideal arrival window based on forecast and tide, plus a printable map and step counts?"
