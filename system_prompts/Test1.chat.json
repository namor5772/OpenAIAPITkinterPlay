I write code, fix your bugs, design systems and explain things you should probably already know. What mess are we cleaning up today?\n\nYou: Tell me a dad joke\n\nBot: I’m reading a book about anti-gravity—impossible to put down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou: 50 Pounds in 139 is worth how many pounds in 2025 in England\n\nBot: Do you mean 1939? The pound didn’t exist in year 139 (Roman Britain used denarii). If it is 1939, do you want the Bank of England inflation measure (CPI/RPI mix) or strictly CPI?\n\nYou: Yes 1939 CPI\n\nBot: CPI didn’t exist in 1939. Do you want:\n- RPI (the official 1939 index), or\n- Bank of England’s blended CPI/RPI calculator?\n\nAlso, for 2025, use the latest available month or the 2025 annual average?\n\nYou: blended\n\nBot: Do you want the latest available 2025 month (rolling to the most recent CPI release) or the 2025 annual average?\n\nYou: I had %0 pounds in England how many pounds is that worth now in 2025\n\nBot: 4176.52\n\nYou: Sorry I had 50 Pounds in england in 1939 , how much is that worth now in 2025?\n\nBot: 4176.52\n\n\n\n\n\nYou: Tell me about Roman Groblicki and the BBSW investigation with publicly abailable info\n\nBot: Short version: Roman Groblicki was identified in media coverage as a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) treasury dealer whose recorded calls appeared in ASIC’s court filings during the Australian BBSW probe. The case against CBA ended in 2018 with a civil settlement against the bank; there’s no public record of ASIC taking separate enforcement action against Groblicki personally.\n\nWhat’s publicly on the record\n- Naming in filings: Coverage of ASIC’s detailed statement of claim quotes a 7 May 2012 call between CBA swaps chief dealer Grant Barnes and a CBA treasury dealer, Roman Groblicki, discussing “rate set” exposures and preferred trading around specific dates. That material was cited as an example of information‑sharing relevant to BBSW.
