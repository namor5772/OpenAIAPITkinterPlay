Tell me the exact query and whether you need recent results (e.g., “latest NVIDIA drivers for Windows 11 as of today”).\n- If you want continuous monitoring (price/scrape), say so and I’ll propose a safe approach.\n\nSummary: Yep — I can and will browse public sites for you when needed, cite what I find, and won’t touch private accounts or perform actions.\n\nYou: compare gpt-5 to gpt-5-mini?\n\nBot: Short answer — GPT‑5 is the high‑accuracy, long‑context, highest‑quality model; GPT‑5‑mini is a smaller, much cheaper, lower‑latency variant that trades some long‑context and reasoning quality for cost and speed. Pick GPT‑5 for mission‑critical reasoning, GPT‑5‑mini for bulk/interactive workloads where budget or latency matter. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhat’s different (quick bullets)\n- Core capability\n  - GPT‑5: highest raw performance on reasoning, coding, multimodal and long‑context tasks. Best for complex, multi‑step, or safety‑sensitive work. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/gpt-5/?utm_source=openai))  \n  - GPT‑5‑mini: noticeably good but behind GPT‑5 on long‑context benchmarks and some reasoning tasks — designed for cost/latency tradeoffs. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai))\n- Context & output limits\n  - API total context (input + output): up to ~400,000 tokens (e.g., ~272k input + 128k output in some docs). Both sizes support that API window, but their effectiveness at extreme lengths differs. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai), [felloai.com](https://felloai.com/2025/08/openai-releases-gpt-5-the-most-powerful-chatgpt-model-yet-bus-is-it-enough/?utm_source=openai))\n- Benchmarks / long‑context behaviour\n  - On OpenAI’s long‑context MRCR benchmarks GPT‑5 beats GPT‑5‑mini by a clear margin (e.g., ~95.2% vs ~84.3% at 128k; larger gaps at 256k). Expect GPT‑5 to retain accuracy better as context grows. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai))\n- Cost & latency (API)\n  - Pricing per 1M tokens (example official published rates): GPT‑5 ≈ $1.25 input / $10 output; GPT‑5‑mini ≈ $0.25 input / $2 output (nano is cheaper). Mini is roughly 4–5x cheaper per token. Use mini where cost dominates. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n- Features & controls\n  - Both support the new API parameters like verbosity and reasoning_effort, parallel tool calls, browsing/file/image tools, and structured outputs — so you can tune for speed vs depth. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n- Safety / hallucinations\n  - GPT‑5 was promoted as being significantly less prone to hallucination than prior models; GPT‑5 still outperforms the mini on safety-relevant benchmarks. If you need conservative factuality, prefer GPT‑5. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhen to choose which (practical rules)\n- Use GPT‑5 (pay for it) when:\n  - You need best possible correctness, complex reasoning, or long‑document understanding (legal, medical research, high‑stakes synthesis).\n  - You rely on tool chains (agentic behavior) and multi‑step workflows.\n- Use GPT‑5‑mini when:\n  - You need cheap, fast responses for chatbots, high‑volume summarisation, UI assistants, or prototype iterations.\n  - You can accept slightly lower accuracy on long, subtle reasoning tasks.\n\nQuick sanity checks / A/B tests to run\n- Small benchmark to compare on your task:\n  1. Pick 10 representative prompts (include a long‑context example).\n  2. Call both models and compare: accuracy, hallucination rate, latency, and cost per call.\n- Example curl (replace YOUR_API_KEY and prompt):\n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-mini\",\n    \"input\": \"Summarise the attached 50‑page report into 5 bullets\",\n    \"max_output_tokens\": 800\n  }'\n```\nRepeat with \"model\": \"gpt-5\" to compare. (Use streaming to measure latency.) ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n\nNotes & caveats\n- The model family and pricing/details above come from OpenAI’s August 2025 rollout; public reaction and exact product behaviour have been evolving since release — if you need up‑to‑the‑minute limits, quotas, or enterprise terms I can fetch the latest account‑specific docs. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/gpt-5/?utm_source=openai), [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/openais-gpt-5-is-here?utm_source=openai))\n- Practical performance depends on prompt engineering, tool configuration, and whether you use “reasoning_effort” or lower latency modes.\n\nNext steps I can do for you\n- Run a quick A/B test design for your exact prompts and estimate monthly cost at your expected usage.\n- Draft example prompt templates tuned for GPT‑5 vs GPT‑5‑mini to maximise accuracy or minimise cost.\n- Fetch the latest account quotas/pricing for your OpenAI account (you’ll need to copy‑paste any billing screenshots or account details).\n\nSummary: GPT‑5 = best accuracy, reasoning and long‑context performance (pay for quality). GPT‑5‑mini = much cheaper/faster, good for high‑volume or latency‑sensitive uses but loses ground on long, high‑precision tasks.

GPT‑5 adds a new \"minimal\" option; otherwise the choices are low, medium (default) and high. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai))\n\nDetails\n- Default and available values\n  - Default: medium (used when you omit any reasoning setting). ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Values for GPT‑5: minimal, low, medium (default), high. For older o‑series reasoning models the options are low/medium/high (minimal is GPT‑5 only). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai), [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072518-controlling-the-length-of-openai-model-responses%23.pls?utm_source=openai))\n- What the levels do\n  - Higher effort => model spends more hidden “reasoning” tokens before producing the visible answer; this typically improves performance on hard, multi‑step reasoning at the cost of latency and token usage. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/reasoning_items?utm_source=openai))  \n  - minimal (GPT‑5) reduces time‑to‑first‑token and emits few/no reasoning tokens — use it for fast deterministic tasks (classification, short formatting). ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n- How to specify it (Responses API / official client)\n  - Example Python (Responses API):\n    ```\n    response = client.responses.create(\n      model=\"gpt-5\",\n      input=[ {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Summarise this 10k-word doc in 5 bullets.\"} ],\n      reasoning={ \"effort\": \"high\" }   # \"minimal\" | \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\"\n    )\n    ```\n    ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n  - Example curl:\n    ```\n    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\n        \"model\":\"gpt-5\",\n        \"input\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Classify sentiment: The cake was awful.\"}],\n        \"reasoning\": {\"effort\":\"minimal\"}\n      }'\n    ```\n    ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n- Implementation notes / gotchas\n  - Some older models or older SDK versions may not support reasoning controls — you’ll get an unknown‑parameter error. Upgrade your client library or check the specific model docs if you see that. ([community.openai.com](https://community.openai.com/t/o1s-reasoning-effort-parameter/1062308?utm_source=openai))  \n  - The API can return encrypted/opaque reasoning items if you request them (useful for stateless workflows); reasoning tokens themselves are not normally printed in the assistant reply. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/reasoning_items?utm_source=openai))\n\nNext steps / checks you can run right now\n- Quick A/B to validate default vs explicit:\n  1. Call the same prompt twice: once with no reasoning field, once with `\"reasoning\":{\"effort\":\"low\"}` (or `\"high\"`).  \n  2. Compare latency, token usage and output quality. Example curl above will do it.  \n- If you see errors:\n  - Check your client library version; upgrade to the latest OpenAI SDK.\n  - Confirm you’re calling a model that supports reasoning controls (gpt‑5 family supports minimal + others). ([help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072518-controlling-the-length-of-openai-model-responses%23.pls?utm_source=openai), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n\nSummary: Omit it and you get medium — explicitly set reasoning.effort (or reasoning in the Responses API) when you want faster answers (minimal/low) or extra deliberation (high).\n\nSources:\n  1. https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai\n  2. https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai\n  3. https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072518-controlling-the-length-of-openai-model-responses%23.pls?utm_source=openai\n  4. https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/reasoning_items?utm_source=openai\n  5. https://community.openai.com/t/o1s-reasoning-effort-parameter/1062308?utm_source=openai\n  6. https://api.openai.com/v1/responses\n\nYou: specific differences between gpt5-mini and gpt5-nano\n\nBot: Short answer: GPT‑5‑mini is the mid‑size, cost‑efficient member of the GPT‑5 family — a balance of speed, cost and capability. GPT‑5‑nano is the smallest, cheapest and fastest: great for high‑volume summarisation/classification where you can tolerate lower reasoning quality. (All specs below are current as of 27 Aug 2025 — I pulled them from OpenAI’s docs.) ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nWhat’s different (concise comparison)\n- Pricing (per 1M tokens, official):  \n  - GPT‑5‑mini: input $0.25 / output $2.00. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))  \n  - GPT‑5‑nano: input $0.05 / output $0.40. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n- Latency & cost tradeoff:  \n  - mini: described as “faster, cheaper” vs the flagship — good middle ground. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))  \n  - nano: described as “the fastest, cheapest” — optimised for throughput/low latency at lowest cost. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n- Capability / accuracy (practical):  \n  - OpenAI designed the sizes to trade performance for cost/latency; expect mini to be noticeably better than nano on subtle reasoning, code editing, and tricky instruction‑following. OpenAI recommends large/mini for everyday developer tasks and mini/nano for simpler, high‑volume tasks. (Exact numeric benchmarks for mini vs nano aren’t published publicly — test on your workload.) ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n- Context window / tokens:  \n  - All GPT‑5 family models in the API support up to 272,000 input tokens + 128,000 output/reasoning tokens (400,000 total context). Use that when planning long‑doc workflows. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n- Feature parity (API capabilities):  \n  - Both support Responses/Chat APIs, streaming, reasoning_effort/minimal, verbosity, built‑in tools and custom tools, fine‑tuning options, and prompt caching/batch API. The difference is primarily model scale, not feature set. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n- Best use cases (practical rule of thumb):\n  - GPT‑5‑mini: faster and cheaper than flagship, good for interactive assistants, moderate‑complexity summarisation, coding help, tool‑using agents where some accuracy trade is acceptable. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n  - GPT‑5‑nano: ultra‑low cost/latency for classification, straightforward summarisation, token‑heavy batch processing, pre‑processing pipelines, and high‑volume chatbots where per‑call cost dominates. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nShort decision guide\n- Need highest accuracy/complex multi‑step reasoning → consider larger models (gpt‑5 or gpt‑5‑mini). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))  \n- Need cheapest per‑token cost and fastest response for simple tasks → gpt‑5‑nano. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nNext steps / Checks you can run (do this; don’t guess)\n1. A/B test (3 representative prompts: short classification, 1k‑token summarisation, 50k‑token long‑context search) and measure: correctness, latency, token usage, cost.  \n   - Example curl (replace API key and prompt):\n     ```\n     curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n       -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n       -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n       -d '{\n         \"model\":\"gpt-5-mini\",\n         \"input\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<your prompt here>\"}],\n         \"max_output_tokens\":800\n       }'\n     ```\n     Repeat with \"model\":\"gpt-5-nano\". ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n2. Measure latency with streaming enabled (time-to-first-token) and overall throughput (requests/sec) if you care about real‑time UI.  \n3. If you rely on long‑context retention, include a very long prompt (50–200k tokens) to see how each model degrades in practice — OpenAI’s 400k window is theoretical maximum; behaviour differs by model. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n4. If cost is primary, run a monthly cost estimate using your expected input/output tokens and the official per‑token prices above. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nNotes, caveats, and citations\n- These spec/pricing facts are from OpenAI’s API/pricing and GPT‑5 announcement (Aug 2025). Product details can change — if you need official, account‑specific pricing or SLA/enterprise options I’ll fetch your latest billing doc or the platform page. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n- Third‑party summaries exist, but prefer the official OpenAI pages for billing/quotas. (I can fetch other benchmarks if you want independent latency/accuracy numbers.) ([wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/openais-gpt-5-is-here?utm_source=openai))\n\nSummary: mini = mid‑size balance (better accuracy/quality than nano, still cheap); nano = lowest cost/fastest for high‑volume simple tasks — test both on your real prompts to be sure. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nWant me to design the three‑prompt A/B test and give you a monthly cost projection? Say “run A/B” and paste the three prompts.\n\n\n\n",

([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n- Features & controls\n  - Both support the new API parameters like verbosity and reasoning_effort, parallel tool calls, browsing/file/image tools, and structured outputs — so you can tune for speed vs depth. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n- Safety / hallucinations\n  - GPT‑5 was promoted as being significantly less prone to hallucination than prior models; GPT‑5 still outperforms the mini on safety-relevant benchmarks. If you need conservative factuality, prefer GPT‑5. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhen to choose which (practical rules)\n- Use GPT‑5 (pay for it) when:\n  - You need best possible correctness, complex reasoning, or long‑document understanding (legal, medical research, high‑stakes synthesis).\n  - You rely on tool chains (agentic behavior) and multi‑step workflows.\n- Use GPT‑5‑mini when:\n  - You need cheap, fast responses for chatbots, high‑volume summarisation, UI assistants, or prototype iterations.\n  - You can accept slightly lower accuracy on long, subtle reasoning tasks.\n\nQuick sanity checks / A/B tests to run\n- Small benchmark to compare on your task:\n  1. Pick 10 representative prompts (include a long‑context example).\n  2. Call both models and compare: accuracy, hallucination rate, latency, and cost per call.\n- Example curl (replace YOUR_API_KEY and prompt):\n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5-mini\",\n    \"input\": \"Summarise the attached 50‑page report into 5 bullets\",\n    \"max_output_tokens\": 800\n  }'\n```\nRepeat with \"model\": \"gpt-5\" to compare. (Use streaming to measure latency.) ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n\nNotes & caveats\n- The model family and pricing/details above come from OpenAI’s August 2025 rollout; public reaction and exact product behaviour have been evolving since release — if you need up‑to‑the‑minute limits, quotas, or enterprise terms I can fetch the latest account‑specific docs. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/gpt-5/?utm_source=openai), [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/openais-gpt-5-is-here?utm_source=openai))\n- Practical performance depends on prompt engineering, tool configuration, and whether you use “reasoning_effort” or lower latency modes.\n\nNext steps I can do for you\n- Run a quick A/B test design for your exact prompts and estimate monthly cost at your expected usage.\n- Draft example prompt templates tuned for GPT‑5 vs GPT‑5‑mini to maximise accuracy or minimise cost.\n- Fetch the latest account quotas/pricing for your OpenAI account (you’ll need to copy‑paste any billing screenshots or account details).\n\nSummary: GPT‑5 = best accuracy, reasoning and long‑context performance (pay for quality). GPT‑5‑mini = much cheaper/faster, good for high‑volume or latency‑sensitive uses but loses ground on long, high‑precision tasks.

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Short answer: Yes — if you don't set a reasoning effort, the model uses medium by default. GPT‑5 adds a new \"minimal\" option; otherwise the choices are low, medium (default) and high. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai))\n\nDetails\n- Default and available values\n  - Default: medium (used when you omit any reasoning setting). ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))  \n  - Values for GPT‑5: minimal, low, medium (default), high. For older o‑series reasoning models the options are low/medium/high (minimal is GPT‑5 only). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai), [help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072518-controlling-the-length-of-openai-model-responses%23.pls?utm_source=openai))\n- What the levels do\n  - Higher effort => model spends more hidden “reasoning” tokens before producing the visible answer; this typically improves performance on hard, multi‑step reasoning at the cost of latency and token usage. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers?utm_source=openai), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/reasoning_items?utm_source=openai))  \n  - minimal (GPT‑5) reduces time‑to‑first‑token and emits few/no reasoning tokens — use it for fast deterministic tasks (classification, short formatting). ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n- How to specify it (Responses API / official client)\n  - Example Python (Responses API):\n    ```\n    response = client.responses.create(\n      model=\"gpt-5\",\n      input=[ {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Summarise this 10k-word doc in 5 bullets.\"} ],\n      reasoning={ \"effort\": \"high\" }   # \"minimal\" | \"low\" | \"medium\" | \"high\"\n    )\n    ```\n    ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n  - Example curl:\n    ```\n    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -d '{\n        \"model\":\"gpt-5\",\n        \"input\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Classify sentiment: The cake was awful.\"}],\n        \"reasoning\": {\"effort\":\"minimal\"}\n      }'\n    ```\n    ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n- Implementation notes / gotchas\n  - Some older models or older SDK versions may not support reasoning controls — you’ll get an unknown‑parameter error. Upgrade your client library or check the specific model docs if you see that. ([community.openai.com](https://community.openai.com/t/o1s-reasoning-effort-parameter/1062308?utm_source=openai))  \n  - The API can return encrypted/opaque reasoning items if you request them (useful for stateless workflows); reasoning tokens themselves are not normally printed in the assistant reply. ([cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/responses_api/reasoning_items?utm_source=openai))\n\nNext steps / checks you can run right now\n- Quick A/B to validate default vs explicit:\n  1. Call the same prompt twice: once with no reasoning field, once with `\"reasoning\":{\"effort\":\"low\"}` (or `\"high\"`).  \n  2. Compare latency, token usage and output quality. Example curl above will do it.  \n- If you see errors:\n  - Check your client library version; upgrade to the latest OpenAI SDK.\n  - Confirm you’re calling a model that supports reasoning controls (gpt‑5 family supports minimal + others). ([help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072518-controlling-the-length-of-openai-model-responses%23.pls?utm_source=openai), [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_new_params_and_tools?utm_source=openai))\n\nSummary: Omit it and you get medium — explicitly set reasoning.effort (or reasoning in the Responses API) when you want faster answers (minimal/low) or extra deliberation (high)."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Short answer: GPT‑5‑mini is the mid‑size, cost‑efficient member of the GPT‑5 family — a balance of speed, cost and capability. GPT‑5‑nano is the smallest, cheapest and fastest: great for high‑volume summarisation/classification where you can tolerate lower reasoning quality. (All specs below are current as of 27 Aug 2025 — I pulled them from OpenAI’s docs.) ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nWhat’s different (concise comparison)\n- Pricing (per 1M tokens, official):  \n  - GPT‑5‑mini: input $0.25 / output $2.00. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))  \n  - GPT‑5‑nano: input $0.05 / output $0.40. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n- Latency & cost tradeoff:  \n  - mini: described as “faster, cheaper” vs the flagship — good middle ground. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))  \n  - nano: described as “the fastest, cheapest” — optimised for throughput/low latency at lowest cost. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n- Capability / accuracy (practical):  \n  - OpenAI designed the sizes to trade performance for cost/latency; expect mini to be noticeably better than nano on subtle reasoning, code editing, and tricky instruction‑following. OpenAI recommends large/mini for everyday developer tasks and mini/nano for simpler, high‑volume tasks. (Exact numeric benchmarks for mini vs nano aren’t published publicly — test on your workload.) ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n- Context window / tokens:  \n  - All GPT‑5 family models in the API support up to 272,000 input tokens + 128,000 output/reasoning tokens (400,000 total context). Use that when planning long‑doc workflows. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n- Feature parity (API capabilities):  \n  - Both support Responses/Chat APIs, streaming, reasoning_effort/minimal, verbosity, built‑in tools and custom tools, fine‑tuning options, and prompt caching/batch API. The difference is primarily model scale, not feature set. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n- Best use cases (practical rule of thumb):\n  - GPT‑5‑mini: faster and cheaper than flagship, good for interactive assistants, moderate‑complexity summarisation, coding help, tool‑using agents where some accuracy trade is acceptable. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n  - GPT‑5‑nano: ultra‑low cost/latency for classification, straightforward summarisation, token‑heavy batch processing, pre‑processing pipelines, and high‑volume chatbots where per‑call cost dominates. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nShort decision guide\n- Need highest accuracy/complex multi‑step reasoning → consider larger models (gpt‑5 or gpt‑5‑mini). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))  \n- Need cheapest per‑token cost and fastest response for simple tasks → gpt‑5‑nano. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nNext steps / Checks you can run (do this; don’t guess)\n1. A/B test (3 representative prompts: short classification, 1k‑token summarisation, 50k‑token long‑context search) and measure: correctness, latency, token usage, cost.  \n   - Example curl (replace API key and prompt):\n     ```\n     curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n       -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n       -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n       -d '{\n         \"model\":\"gpt-5-mini\",\n         \"input\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"<your prompt here>\"}],\n         \"max_output_tokens\":800\n       }'\n     ```\n     Repeat with \"model\":\"gpt-5-nano\". ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n2. Measure latency with streaming enabled (time-to-first-token) and overall throughput (requests/sec) if you care about real‑time UI.  \n3. If you rely on long‑context retention, include a very long prompt (50–200k tokens) to see how each model degrades in practice — OpenAI’s 400k window is theoretical maximum; behaviour differs by model. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n4. If cost is primary, run a monthly cost estimate using your expected input/output tokens and the official per‑token prices above. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nNotes, caveats, and citations\n- These spec/pricing facts are from OpenAI’s API/pricing and GPT‑5 announcement (Aug 2025). Product details can change — if you need official, account‑specific pricing or SLA/enterprise options I’ll fetch your latest billing doc or the platform page. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n- Third‑party summaries exist, but prefer the official OpenAI pages for billing/quotas. (I can fetch other benchmarks if you want independent latency/accuracy numbers.) ([wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/openais-gpt-5-is-here?utm_source=openai))\n\nSummary: mini = mid‑size balance (better accuracy/quality than nano, still cheap); nano = lowest cost/fastest for high‑volume simple tasks — test both on your real prompts to be sure. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/api/pricing/))\n\nWant me to design the three‑prompt A/B test and give you a monthly cost projection? Say “run A/B” and paste the three prompts."
