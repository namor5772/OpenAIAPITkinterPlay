Different spectra can look identical (metamers), because perception, not physics, calls the shots.\n- Mixing: Additive (RGB light—screens) versus subtractive (CMYK pigments—ink) produce colors by different mechanisms.\n\nShort version: color is an interaction among light, materials, and your visual system—more a controlled hallucination than a property of the world.\n\nYou: what is color\n\nBot: It’s “colour,” and it’s your brain’s best guess about the light hitting your eyes—not a property glued to objects.\n\n- Physics: Objects have reflectance spectra; light (≈380–700 nm) varies by wavelength.\n- Biology: Three cone types (S, M, L) feed opponent channels (red–green, blue–yellow, light–dark).\n- Perception: The brain does colour constancy and bins experience into hue, saturation, and lightness; different spectra can look identical (metamers).\n- Mixing: Additive RGB (light) versus subtractive CMYK (pigments) achieve colours by opposite mechanisms.\n\nShort version: colour = interaction of illumination, material, and visual processing—a very reliable hallucination.\n\n\n",
