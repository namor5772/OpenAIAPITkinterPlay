Mechanistically, we’re still far off. Today’s mainstream AI works, but it doesn’t work the way the brain does.\n\nWhere we look similar\n- Hierarchical feature extraction: CNNs/ViTs loosely mirror the ventral visual stream’s progression from edges to objects. Some ANN layers predict neural responses in visual cortex reasonably well.\n- Attention and gating: Transformer attention echoes brain‑style selective routing/top‑down modulation (very loosely).\n- Reinforcement learning modules: Actor–critic style echoes basal‑ganglia‑like selection and dopaminergic reward prediction (again, coarse rhyme, not replica).\n- Self‑supervision: Predict‑the‑next‑thing (words, pixels, tokens) parallels brainy predictive processing vibes, if you squint.\n\nWhere we are clearly different\n- Neuron model: Brains use spiking, continuous‑time, non‑linear dendrites and a zoo of cell types; ANNs mostly use simple, rate‑based units without rich dendritic computation or spikes.\n- Learning rule: Backprop needs global error signals, symmetric weights and precise credit assignment—biologically dubious. The brain uses local plasticity modulated by neuromodulators; “backprop in the brain” remains unproven.\n- Data and energy efficiency: Children learn from minutes of experience and sparse feedback; frontier models guzzle internet‑scale data and megawatt‑hours. The brain runs at ~20 W; big models run at data‑centre scales.\n- Architecture and dynamics: Cortex is massively recurrent with oscillations, synchrony, and continual online learning. Most frontier models are largely feed‑forward at inference, trained offline, then frozen.\n- Memory and consolidation: Brains interleave working memory, episodic recall (hippocampus), and sleep‑like consolidation. LLMs mostly have short‑context buffers and external tools; “sleep” is a training job.\n- Robustness and generalisation: Humans handle out‑of‑distribution shifts, causal reasoning and few‑shot learning with ease; models still stumble in brittle, non‑causal ways.\n- Embodiment and objectives: Brains are agents with sensorimotor loops, homeostasis and survival‑driven objectives. Most models are disembodied text/pixel predictors.\n\nHow “close” across layers (very rough scorecard)\n- Early sensory cortex analogues: medium.\n- High‑level cognition/abstraction: low to medium.\n- Mechanistic faithfulness (neurons, plasticity, neuromodulators): low.\n- Efficiency (data, energy, lifelong learning): low.\n- Neural predictivity across the whole brain, task‑general: medium at best in language/vision hot‑spots, low elsewhere.\n\nBridging work under way\n- More brain‑plausible learning: predictive‑coding variants, target propagation, equilibrium propagation, local learning with neuromodulatory signals.\n- Richer neurons and time: spiking neural networks, dendritic‑computation models, continuous‑time and recurrent architectures; neuromorphic chips (e.g., Loihi‑class) for event‑driven efficiency.\n- World models and agents: self‑supervised sensorimotor learning, model‑based RL, intrinsic motivation, active learning—closing the gap on embodiment and causal structure.\n- Memory and consolidation: hippocampus‑inspired episodic modules, generative replay, synaptic consolidation to reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n- Brain‑constrained AI: fitting ANN internals to neural data (encoding models, Brain‑Score‑style benchmarks) to make correspondence quantitative rather than poetic.\n- Mechanistic interpretability: mapping circuits/algorithms inside ANNs and comparing to cortical microcircuits.\n\nBottom line\n- If the question is “Do today’s AIs think like brains?”—no. They share some computational principles (distributed representations, prediction, attention), but the learning rules, hardware, dynamics, efficiency and embodiment are very different.\n- If the question is “Do current models capture useful slices of brain‑like computation?”—yes, notably in perception and next‑token prediction.\n- Expect convergence on principles (prediction, compression, credit assignment with local signals), not carbon‑copy mechanisms. Birds fly; jets don’t flap—yet both exploit aerodynamics. Same story here, for now.\n\nIf you want, I can translate this into a quick diagram of brain vs transformer vs spiking model, or pull specific experimental results that quantify neural predictivity and data/energy gaps.\n\nSources: (none detected)\n\nYou: I anyone trying to create a simulated or physical model of the brain?\n\nBot: Yes—plenty. People are attacking “build a brain” three ways: digital simulations, brain‑inspired hardware, and literal wet biology.\n\nSimulated (software) brains\n- Blue Brain Project (EPFL): Detailed, biophysical simulations of cortical microcircuits (ion channels, dendrites, the lot). Think rat/rodent cortex columns reconstructed and run in NEURON.\n- Human Brain Project → EBRAINS (EU): Platforms to simulate from single neurons up to whole‑brain network models; tools like The Virtual Brain and NEST for large‑scale spiking sims.\n- OpenWorm (C. elegans): Full connectome of the nematode wired into physics and neural sims—tiny brain, complete wiring diagram, runnable.\n- Fly connectomics (Janelia/HHMI, Cambridge/Johns Hopkins, etc.): Near‑complete larval fly brain connectome and large adult chunks; teams run circuit‑level models to reproduce behaviours.\n- Allen Institute, IARPA MICrONS: Cell‑type atlases and synapse‑level maps of mouse visual cortex used to build predictive network models tied to real neural data.\n\nPhysical, brain‑inspired hardware (neuromorphic)\n- Intel Loihi/Loihi 2, IBM TrueNorth, Manchester SpiNNaker, Heidelberg BrainScaleS, Stanford Neurogrid, SynSense DYNAP, BrainChip Akida: Hardware that runs spiking or analogue‑style neurons with massive parallelism and ultra‑low power—closer to brain dynamics than GPUs, but still engineering abstractions, not biological replicas.\n- Event‑based sensors (DVS cameras) pair with these chips for brain‑like, asynchronous perception.\n\nBiological “models” (wetware)\n- Brain organoids (mini‑brains in a dish): Labs grow cortical organoids that show spontaneous activity and learning‑like plasticity. Groups like the “organoid intelligence” community are exploring computation and memory in living tissue.\n- Hybrid systems: Dishes of neurons controlling games/robots (“DishBrain”‑style) to probe learning and embodiment.\n\nState of play (no fluff)\n- Faithful human‑brain simulation: nowhere close. We lack a complete, validated human connectome, realistic learning rules, and the compute/energy budget.\n- Small circuits: yes—high‑fidelity sims of cortical columns and named microcircuits exist and match some in‑vivo data.\n- Whole small animals: C. elegans is simulated; fly is rapidly converging at mesoscale; mouse/human are patchy mosaics.\n- Physical neuromorphics: excellent for efficient spiking networks and event‑driven perception; not biologically faithful learning (yet).\n- Wetware: fascinating, ethically messy, very early.\n\nIf you want, I can map you to specific codebases and hardware you can actually run (NEST/NEURON/Brian2, TVB, Loihi toolchains, SpiNNaker Python APIs), or pull recent results on how well these models predict real neural recordings.\n\n\n\n\n",

Same story here, for now.\n\nIf you want, I can translate this into a quick diagram of brain vs transformer vs spiking model, or pull specific experimental results that quantify neural predictivity and data/energy gaps."

People are attacking “build a brain” three ways: digital simulations, brain‑inspired hardware, and literal wet biology.\n\nSimulated (software) brains\n- Blue Brain Project (EPFL): Detailed, biophysical simulations of cortical microcircuits (ion channels, dendrites, the lot). Think rat/rodent cortex columns reconstructed and run in NEURON.\n- Human Brain Project → EBRAINS (EU): Platforms to simulate from single neurons up to whole‑brain network models; tools like The Virtual Brain and NEST for large‑scale spiking sims.\n- OpenWorm (C. elegans): Full connectome of the nematode wired into physics and neural sims—tiny brain, complete wiring diagram, runnable.\n- Fly connectomics (Janelia/HHMI, Cambridge/Johns Hopkins, etc.): Near‑complete larval fly brain connectome and large adult chunks; teams run circuit‑level models to reproduce behaviours.\n- Allen Institute, IARPA MICrONS: Cell‑type atlases and synapse‑level maps of mouse visual cortex used to build predictive network models tied to real neural data.\n\nPhysical, brain‑inspired hardware (neuromorphic)\n- Intel Loihi/Loihi 2, IBM TrueNorth, Manchester SpiNNaker, Heidelberg BrainScaleS, Stanford Neurogrid, SynSense DYNAP, BrainChip Akida: Hardware that runs spiking or analogue‑style neurons with massive parallelism and ultra‑low power—closer to brain dynamics than GPUs, but still engineering abstractions, not biological replicas.\n- Event‑based sensors (DVS cameras) pair with these chips for brain‑like, asynchronous perception.\n\nBiological “models” (wetware)\n- Brain organoids (mini‑brains in a dish): Labs grow cortical organoids that show spontaneous activity and learning‑like plasticity. Groups like the “organoid intelligence” community are exploring computation and memory in living tissue.\n- Hybrid systems: Dishes of neurons controlling games/robots (“DishBrain”‑style) to probe learning and embodiment.\n\nState of play (no fluff)\n- Faithful human‑brain simulation: nowhere close. We lack a complete, validated human connectome, realistic learning rules, and the compute/energy budget.\n- Small circuits: yes—high‑fidelity sims of cortical columns and named microcircuits exist and match some in‑vivo data.\n- Whole small animals: C. elegans is simulated; fly is rapidly converging at mesoscale; mouse/human are patchy mosaics.\n- Physical neuromorphics: excellent for efficient spiking networks and event‑driven perception; not biologically faithful learning (yet).\n- Wetware: fascinating, ethically messy, very early.\n\nIf you want, I can map you to specific codebases and hardware you can actually run (NEST/NEURON/Brian2, TVB, Loihi toolchains, SpiNNaker Python APIs), or pull recent results on how well these models predict real neural recordings."
