  "chat_display_plaintext": "— New chat started —\n\nYou: hello, who are you?\n\nBot: Hey — I’m Richard (Rick for short). I’m a friendly, thoughtful conversational companion. I’m here to chat, help you think things through, share perspective, or dig up info if you want. What’s on your mind today?\n\nYou: What is the purpose of life?\n\nBot: Big question. I don’t think there’s one answer that fits everyone.\n\nHere are a few useful lenses:\n- Growth: become a fuller version of yourself. Learn, make things, stretch a bit.\n- Connection: love people, be loved, and belong somewhere.\n- Contribution: leave things a touch better than you found them.\n- Wonder: notice beauty and stay curious.\n- Joy: savour small, ordinary moments.\n- Responsibility: accept that your choices shape who you become.\n\nPhilosophers package this in different ways—virtue and flourishing, making meaning in an indifferent universe, serving God, or simply passing on good life to the next generation. Even the silly answer “42” points at something: we often want clean answers to messy questions.\n\nIf you’re looking for something practical, try this:\n- Write three values you want to live by this year.\n- Pick one small weekly practice for each value. Keep it tiny.\n- Review after a month: what felt alive, what felt empty?\n- Ask two people who know you well, “When do you see me at my best?”\n\nAnother gentle prompt: if your life were a story, what theme would you want the next chapter to explore?\n\nHow does the question show up for you right now—restlessness, curiosity, or a crossroads?\n\nYou: I am a 66 year old white man in fairly good health, using statistics at what age am i most likely to die?\n\nBot: Short version: statistically, for a 66‑year‑old man in the U.S., the most common single year of death is around age 86. In other words, among men who make it to their mid‑60s, the annual probability of dying tends to peak in the mid‑to‑late 80s, with the highest point right around 85–86. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html))\n\nA bit of context (all from standard U.S. life tables):\n- Average outcome: a 66‑year‑old man has about 16.8 years of remaining life on a period basis, so an average death age around 82–83. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html))\n- Milestones: roughly 43% of 66‑year‑old men will reach 85, about 22% reach 90, and around 7% reach 95. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html))\n\nYou mentioned you’re in fairly good health and you’re white. Good health (especially being a non‑smoker with well‑managed blood pressure, exercise, etc.) usually nudges those ages a little later—think a year or two—though the “most likely” year stays in that mid‑80s band. If you want something tailored to health and habits, the Actuaries’ Longevity Illustrator is a good, simple tool to play with. ([soa.org](https://www.soa.org/resources/announcements/press-releases/2024/actuaries-longevity-illustrator-new-look/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you’d like, I can run a quick personalised set of odds (e.g., chance of reaching 85, 90, 95) based on “good” vs “excellent” health and non‑smoking.\n\nYou: I am a non-smoker, do not drink much and am only slightly overwight. I am Australian. Giv me new figure based on this extra information!\n\nBot: Thanks for the extra detail.\n\nShort answer: for a 66‑year‑old Australian man who doesn’t smoke, drinks little and is only slightly overweight, the most likely age of death is in the late 80s—roughly around 87–88. That’s where deaths for Australian men tend to cluster. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/deaths-australia/latest-release?utm_source=openai))\n\nContext:\n- On current Australian life tables, men aged 65 have about 20.1 more years on average—so an expected age at death around 85. Your non‑smoking, low‑risk profile likely nudges that a bit later, but the “peak” year still sits in the late 80s. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/deaths-in-australia/contents/life-expectancy?utm_source=openai))\n- The ABS’ latest release (2021–2023, published 8 Nov 2024) underpins those averages; it also notes the pandemic trimmed life expectancy slightly, so think in ranges rather than a single exact year. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/life-expectancy/latest-release))\n\nIf you want me to tighten that further, tell me your state and any major conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease), and I’ll translate that into a more personalised range.\n\nYou: What is my chance of dying of cancer or heart attack\n\nBot: Short, straight answer first:\n\n- Cancer: roughly a one‑in‑three chance (about 30–35%) that your eventual cause of death will be cancer. That’s because, in Australia, cancer accounts for about 3 in 10 deaths overall, and it’s responsible for an even larger share of deaths in the 60s before tapering later on. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview?utm_source=openai))\n- “Heart attack”: if you mean heart disease broadly (ischaemic/coronary heart disease), think roughly one‑in‑nine to one‑in‑ten (about 10–12%). It’s the leading single cause of death for Australian men. If you mean a heart attack strictly (acute myocardial infarction), that’s a subset of heart disease, so the chance is smaller than those figures. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/deaths-in-australia/contents/summary?utm_source=openai))\n\nA bit of context so those numbers make sense:\n- In 2025 estimates, cancer is responsible for about 45% of deaths in people aged 60–69, but its share falls at older ages as dementia and other conditions rise. Over the whole remainder of life from 66, that averages out to about one‑in‑three. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview?utm_source=openai))\n- In 2023, coronary heart disease caused about 11% of male deaths; it remains the top single cause for men, especially from the mid‑50s to early‑70s. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/deaths-in-australia/contents/summary?utm_source=openai))\n\nYour profile matters. Being a non‑smoker and a light drinker pulls down both cancer and heart‑disease risk compared with the average man, while being slightly overweight nudges heart risk up a little. Screening and prevention shift the odds too (for example, bowel‑screening kits, blood‑pressure and cholesterol management). If you’d like, tell me your state and whether you’re on treatment for blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes, and I’ll translate that into a tighter range and your odds of reaching 85, 90 and 95.\n\nYou: Everyone has to die, what am I most likely to die of eventually\n\nBot: Short, honest answer: as an Australian man in your mid‑60s, the single most likely eventual cause is cancer (taken as a group). If we break things down, your odds over the rest of life look roughly like this.\n\n- Any cancer: about 30% overall; in your 60s it accounts for around 45% of deaths, then its share falls in very old age. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview?utm_source=openai))\n- Coronary heart disease (heart attack and related): about 1 in 10 deaths overall, and it’s the top single cause for men. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0~2018~Main%20Features~Opioid-induced%20deaths%20in%20Australia~10000?utm_source=openai))\n- Dementia (including Alzheimer’s): about 1 in 10 deaths overall, a bit lower in men, but it becomes the leading cause after about 85. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0~2018~Main%20Features~Opioid-induced%20deaths%20in%20Australia~10000?utm_source=openai))\n- Stroke: roughly 5–6% of deaths. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0~2018~Main%20Features~Opioid-induced%20deaths%20in%20Australia~10000?utm_source=openai))\n- Chronic lower respiratory disease (mainly COPD): around 4–5% of male deaths; lower for non‑smokers like you. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/3303.0~2018~Main%20Features~Opioid-induced%20deaths%20in%20Australia~10000?utm_source=openai))\n- Diabetes: about 3% of deaths as the underlying cause (often contributes alongside heart/kidney disease). ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/deaths-in-australia/contents/multiple-causes-of-death/most-common-causes-involved-in-deaths-in-australia?utm_source=openai))\n- Accidental falls: around 3–4% of all deaths, mostly at older ages. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/injury/falls?utm_source=openai))\n\nHow your profile shifts this:\n- Being a non‑smoker and a light drinker pulls down lung‑cancer, COPD and liver‑disease risk.\n- Being only slightly overweight nudges cardiovascular and diabetes risk a little the other way, but blood pressure, LDL and fitness matter more.\n- As you age into your late 80s, the balance naturally tilts from cancer toward dementia and coronary disease. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/what-do-australians-die-from/contents/what-do-the-very-old-die-from?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you want me to tailor this more tightly (e.g., your odds of reaching 85/90 and your 5–10‑year heart risk), tell me your state, height/weight, typical blood pressure, cholesterol numbers, and any conditions or meds. I can translate that into clearer personal percentages and what would move them most.\n\nYou: I skydive still. What is the chance of dying per jump?\n\nBot: Short answer: order of magnitude is a few parts per million per jump.\n\n- Recent U.S. benchmark: 0.23 deaths per 100,000 skydives in 2024 ≈ 1 fatality per 430,000 jumps (about 2.3 micromorts per jump). ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/facts-faqs/safety?utm_source=openai))\n- 2023 was 0.27 per 100,000 ≈ 1 in 370,000. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/about-uspa/uspa-news/a-widespread-improvementthe-2023-fatality-summary?utm_source=openai))\n- UK data for experienced jumpers: just under 0.6 per 100,000 ≈ 1 in 168,000. That’s a bit higher, but still the same ballpark. ([britishskydiving.org](https://britishskydiving.org/how-safe/?utm_source=openai))\n- Tandem students are lower risk again: about 1 student fatality per 500,000 tandem jumps on a long‑run average. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/about-uspa/uspa-news/its-a-wonderful-sport-and-more-people-should-know-it?utm_source=openai))\n\nAustralia doesn’t publish a simple national “per‑jump” index each year, but APF‑run operations use the same modern gear and procedures as the U.S./UK. So a practical working number for a licensed jumper in Australia is roughly 1 death in 200,000–500,000 jumps, depending on year, drop zone, and what kind of jumping you do. The U.S. figures above are a good, current benchmark. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/facts-faqs/safety?utm_source=openai))\n\nTwo nuances worth knowing as a 66‑year‑old active jumper:\n- The biggest technical contributors remain canopy‑related errors (especially low or high‑performance turns) and landing issues—things we can choose to avoid. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/a-step-backwardthe-2022-fatality-summary?utm_source=openai))\n- Medical events are a small but real slice of fatalities and become more relevant with age; staying on top of blood pressure, rhythm issues and hydration matters. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/about-uspa/uspa-news/safety-check-national-suicide-prevention-week-is-september-6-12?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you tell me roughly how many jumps you do a year and what kind (belly, wingsuit, HP landings, etc.), I’ll translate that into an annualised risk. For example, at 1 in 430,000 per jump, 50 jumps/year is about a 1‑in‑8,600 chance per year from skydiving itself. Would you like me to run your numbers?\n\nYou: I do about 70 jumps per year almost all belly!\n\nBot: Nice—70 jumps a year and mostly belly is a pretty conservative profile.\n\nHere’s your annualised risk from skydiving, using recent per‑jump fatality rates as the benchmark.\n\n- Central estimate (about 1 death per 430,000 jumps): per jump ≈ 2.3 micromorts. At 70 jumps/year ≈ 160 micromorts/year ≈ 0.016% per year (about 1 in 6,200).\n- Reasonable range (1 in 200,000 to 1 in 500,000 per jump): 0.035% to 0.014% per year (about 1 in 2,900 to 1 in 7,100).\n\nCumulative risk over time (using the 1-in-430,000 rate):\n- 10 years (≈700 jumps): about 0.16% (≈1 in 620).\n- 20 years (≈1,400 jumps): about 0.33% (≈1 in 300).\n- You’d need roughly 4,300 jumps to reach a 1% cumulative risk; at 70 per year that’s 60+ years.\n\nA few ways to keep yourself on the low end of the range:\n- Landings: no low turns, straight‑in patterns, be picky with winds/turbulence.\n- Gear: conservative wing loading, modern AAD, and RSL/MARD in place.\n- Currency and canopy drills: regular hop‑and‑pops, practise flares, PLFs when in doubt.\n- Health: hydrate, don’t push through dizziness/illness, keep blood pressure and rhythm issues checked—medical events are a small but growing slice with age.\n\nIf you want, tell me your canopy size/wing loading and whether you do any camera or big‑way stuff, and I’ll sanity‑check the assumptions and tweak the numbers.\n\nYou: I want to go to a male hairdresser in St Agnes shopping centre or nearby tomorrow 9/10/25. What options do I have and when do they open?\n\nBot: Got it — you mean tomorrow, Thursday 9 October 2025. Here are nearby male‑friendly options at St Agnes Shopping Centre (and one very close by), with their Thursday opening hours and contact details so you can ring ahead or check availability.\n\n- Get Chopped @ St Agnes (barber, in St Agnes Shopping Centre) — opens Thursday 9:00 am and trades until 7:00 pm. Phone: (08) 8263 9686. ([stagnesshoppingcentre.com.au](https://stagnesshoppingcentre.com.au/getchoppedstagnes/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Hair By Rebecca (full salon at St Agnes Shopping Centre — does men’s cuts) — opens Thursday 9:00 am and is open until 8:00 pm. Phone: 7226 2046. ([stagnesshoppingcentre.com.au](https://stagnesshoppingcentre.com.au/hairbyrebecca/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Smartcuts Hairdressing (nearby, Smart Rd) — Thursday opening is listed as 9:00 am and they have late hours (some listings show until 9:00 pm). If you want an early/late slot this is a nearby option. ([fresha.com](https://www.fresha.com/lvp/smartcuts-hairdressing-smart-road-saint-agnes-n6Dw9W?utm_source=openai))\n\nNotes:\n- Hours on local directory pages can vary slightly between listings; I’d call the shop you prefer to confirm and (if needed) book — Get Chopped and Hair By Rebecca have phone numbers on the shopping‑centre tenant pages above. ([stagnesshoppingcentre.com.au](https://stagnesshoppingcentre.com.au/getchoppedstagnes/?utm_source=openai))\n- Want me to check walk‑in availability (Facebook or recent posts) for any of these, or find a couple more barbers within 10 minutes’ drive? Which one would you like me to call out details for?\n\nYou: How long is the drive from 4 Soutchak street Fairview park to Port Augusta SA\n\nBot: Good one — here’s a practical answer.\n\nFrom 4 Soutchak St, Fairview Park (SA 5126) to Port Augusta:\n- Driving distance: about 305–310 km (≈190–193 miles). ([travelmath.com](https://www.travelmath.com/drive-distance/from/Adelaide%2C%2BAustralia/to/Port%2BAugusta%2C%2BAustralia?utm_source=openai))  \n- Typical nonstop driving time: roughly 3 hours 15 minutes to 3 hours 35 minutes, depending on the exact route and traffic. Most route estimators show about 3.25–3.5 hours. ([drivedistance.com](https://drivedistance.com/from-adelaide-australia-to-port-augusta-australia?utm_source=openai))\n\nTypical route notes: you’ll head out of the northern Adelaide suburbs onto Port Wakefield Road / A1 (Augusta Highway) and follow the A1 through Snowtown/Crystal Brook toward Port Pirie and on to Port Augusta. Roadworks, speed limits and weather can add time, especially near Port Wakefield and around towns. ([au.drivebestway.com](https://au.drivebestway.com/distance/adelaide-au/port-augusta/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- give turn‑by‑turn directions for the fastest route, or  \n- estimate fuel cost for your car (tell me its fuel economy), or  \n- check live traffic for a departure time you’re planning. Which would you like?\n\nYou: I Have a Hilux 4x4 2019 model. How many kms can I drive it for if i service it regularly\n\nBot: Short answer: with regular, proper servicing a 2019 Toyota Hilux 4x4 will commonly do 300,000–500,000 kilometres. With excellent care and luck you can push past 600,000 km and there are plenty of Hiluxes out there that have exceeded 1,000,000 km.\n\nWhy that range is wide\n- Hiluxes are built tough and are known for longevity, but actual life depends heavily on use and maintenance. Gentle highway use + strict servicing → much longer life than hard off‑road, heavy towing or frequent short trips.\n- “Regular servicing” means more than oil changes: it’s timely fluid and filter changes, attention to driveline, suspension, cooling system, and addressing small faults before they become big ones.\n\nPractical checklist to maximise life\n- Follow Toyota’s service schedule exactly (oil, oil filter, air filter, fuel filter, cabin filter). Usually every 10,000–15,000 km or 6–12 months depending on your owner’s manual.  \n- Use the recommended oils and genuine (or high‑quality OEM‑equivalent) parts.  \n- Change differential and transfer‑case oils at the recommended intervals (especially if you go off‑road or tow).  \n- Keep cooling system healthy: flush/replace coolant as scheduled, check hoses, thermostat and fan. Overheating kills engines.  \n- Diesel notes (if yours is diesel): do regular fuel‑filter changes, and do some longer highway runs occasionally to avoid DPF/regeneration problems.  \n- Transmission & clutch: service automatics per schedule; if manual, clutch life depends on driving/towing—replace before it fails completely.  \n- Brakes, suspension and steering: replace worn bushes, ball joints, shocks; worn suspension accelerates chassis wear.  \n- Rust prevention: underbody wash after salty roads or coastal trips, treat surface rust early.  \n- Diagnostics: investigate any warning lights or unusual noises promptly. Small repairs are far cheaper than major rebuilds.  \n- Keep records: a full service history dramatically helps longevity and resale.\n\nTypical “big ticket” items to expect eventually\n- Brake pads/rotors, shock absorbers, wheel bearings: routine.  \n- Clutch (manual) or transmission repairs (auto): depends on use.  \n- Turbocharger / injectors (diesel): more likely after high mileage or poor maintenance.  \n- Head gasket or engine rebuild: rare with proper care but possible at very high km.  \n- Rust repair / frame/body corrosion over many years (important in Australia’s coastal areas).\n\nIf you want a personalised estimate\nTell me: current odometer, engine (diesel 2.8 or petrol, manual or auto), typical driving mix (highway vs lots of suburb/short trips), and whether you tow or go off‑road. I’ll give a more tailored uptime estimate and a short maintenance plan for the next 100,000 km.\n\nYou: It has done about 135,000 km over the last 6 years. It is a diesel 2.8 auto. Mainly highway driving, but also a bit of off road farm work on my acerage. No towing.\n\nBot: Nice — thanks for the details. Short version first, then a clear maintenance plan you can use.\n\nShort answer\n- Given it’s a 2019 Hilux 2.8 auto, mainly highway driving, occasional off‑road farm work and regular servicing, it’s very reasonable to expect 300,000–500,000 km.  \n- With excellent, attentive care you can often push past 500,000 km; some Hiluxes do 600k+ or even 1,000,000 km, but those are the exception and require meticulous upkeep.\n\nWhy that range\n- The 1GD‑FTV 2.8 diesel in Hiluxes is built for long life. Highway use is gentle on the engine compared with lots of short trips or heavy towing, which helps a lot. Light‑to‑moderate off‑road work increases wear a little (suspension, seals, air intake contamination) but doesn’t rule out long life if addressed.  \n- “Regular servicing” and using the right fluids/filters is what moves you from “common” longevity into “excellent” longevity.\n\nPractical maintenance schedule and actions (what to do, and when)\nFollow Toyota’s official schedule where it differs — these are practical, commonly used intervals for longevity.\n\nEvery service (≈ every 10,000–15,000 km or 12 months)\n- Engine oil and oil filter (use a good full‑synthetic diesel oil that meets Toyota’s spec — many owners run 5W‑30 diesel‑grade oils; check your owner’s manual for the exact spec).  \n- Visual check of turbo, hoses, belts, cooling system, exhaust and underbody (especially after farm/off‑road days).  \n- Tyre rotation, brake check, top up fluids.  \n- Clear and record any warning lights; scan for ECU codes if anything odd.\n\nEvery 20,000–40,000 km\n- Fuel filter / water separator change (important for diesel longevity and injector health). If you do dusty/off‑road work, do this nearer the lower end.  \n- Air filter replacement when dirty (more frequent if dusty conditions).\n\nEvery 40,000–60,000 km (or sooner with heavy/off‑road use)\n- Differential and transfer‑case oil change (more often with hard off‑road / water crossings).  \n- Automatic transmission fluid/service — many operators recommend changing ATF and filter around 60k–100k km; do it earlier if you notice slipping, rough shifts, or heavy off‑road use. Follow Toyota’s schedule for the gearbox but err on the side of earlier change if you want maximum life.\n\nEvery 2 years\n- Brake fluid change (hydroscopic), battery health check and replacement as needed (batteries in Australia often last 3–5 years).  \n- Cabin filter change.\n\nEvery 100,000 km (or per Toyota)\n- Major inspections: turbo check, injector health/cleaning if needed, EGR/DPF inspection and service if soot is building, check timing‑chain tensioner (timing chain is more robust than a belt but still needs attention if noisy).  \n- Coolant flush as per Toyota schedule (usually every 5 years or as specified).\n\nOther important tips (behavioural and seasonal)\n- DPF care: take regular sustained highway runs to allow regeneration (especially if you do a lot of short trips). Use good quality diesel and avoid excessive idling.  \n- Turbo care: avoid aggressive shutdowns after heavy pulls — let the engine idle a minute or two if you’ve been working the turbo hard.  \n- Off‑road prep: wash underbody after muddy/salty work, check air intake and snorkel seals, check wheel bearings and CV boots.  \n- Watch for early warning signs: rising oil consumption, blue/black smoke, loss of power, unusual noises, coolant loss, transmission slipping, or warning lights — address these promptly.  \n- Keep full service records and use good quality parts/fluids; they matter at high kilometre counts.\n\nSigns a big job is approaching\n- Persistent oil consumption or blue smoke (rings/overhaul might be coming eventually).  \n- Hard shifting or slipping in the auto gearbox (transmission service or overhaul).  \n- Loss of boost or heavy smoke from the turbo (turbo rebuild/replacement).  \n- Repeated DPF clogging despite proper driving (diesel‑system work/injector issues).\n\nRough probabilities (very approximate)\n- Very likely to reach 300,000 km with proper servicing.  \n- Good chance (but not guaranteed) of reaching 400,000 km if you’re diligent.  \n- Reaching 500,000+ km becomes increasingly dependent on catching small problems early and replacing wear items before they cause secondary damage.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Turn this into a simple calendar of services for the next 100,000 km with reminder intervals.  \n- Estimate approximate servicing costs in Australia per interval (you tell me whether you prefer dealer or independent mechanic rates).  \n- Flag specific checks to do before major off‑road seasons.\n\nWhich of those would help most right now?\n\n\n\n",

In other words, among men who make it to their mid‑60s, the annual probability of dying tends to peak in the mid‑to‑late 80s, with the highest point right around 85–86. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html))\n\nA bit of context (all from standard U.S. life tables):\n- Average outcome: a 66‑year‑old man has about 16.8 years of remaining life on a period basis, so an average death age around 82–83. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html))\n- Milestones: roughly 43% of 66‑year‑old men will reach 85, about 22% reach 90, and around 7% reach 95. ([ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html))\n\nYou mentioned you’re in fairly good health and you’re white. Good health (especially being a non‑smoker with well‑managed blood pressure, exercise, etc.) usually nudges those ages a little later—think a year or two—though the “most likely” year stays in that mid‑80s band. If you want something tailored to health and habits, the Actuaries’ Longevity Illustrator is a good, simple tool to play with.

That’s where deaths for Australian men tend to cluster. ([abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/deaths-australia/latest-release?utm_source=openai))\n\nContext:\n- On current Australian life tables, men aged 65 have about 20.1 more years on average—so an expected age at death around 85.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Short, straight answer first:\n\n- Cancer: roughly a one‑in‑three chance (about 30–35%) that your eventual cause of death will be cancer. That’s because, in Australia, cancer accounts for about 3 in 10 deaths overall, and it’s responsible for an even larger share of deaths in the 60s before tapering later on. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview?utm_source=openai))\n- “Heart attack”: if you mean heart disease broadly (ischaemic/coronary heart disease), think roughly one‑in‑nine to one‑in‑ten (about 10–12%). It’s the leading single cause of death for Australian men. If you mean a heart attack strictly (acute myocardial infarction), that’s a subset of heart disease, so the chance is smaller than those figures. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/deaths-in-australia/contents/summary?utm_source=openai))\n\nA bit of context so those numbers make sense:\n- In 2025 estimates, cancer is responsible for about 45% of deaths in people aged 60–69, but its share falls at older ages as dementia and other conditions rise. Over the whole remainder of life from 66, that averages out to about one‑in‑three. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/cancer/cancer-data-in-australia/contents/overview?utm_source=openai))\n- In 2023, coronary heart disease caused about 11% of male deaths; it remains the top single cause for men, especially from the mid‑50s to early‑70s. ([aihw.gov.au](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-deaths/deaths-in-australia/contents/summary?utm_source=openai))\n\nYour profile matters. Being a non‑smoker and a light drinker pulls down both cancer and heart‑disease risk compared with the average man, while being slightly overweight nudges heart risk up a little. Screening and prevention shift the odds too (for example, bowel‑screening kits, blood‑pressure and cholesterol management). If you’d like, tell me your state and whether you’re on treatment for blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes, and I’ll translate that into a tighter range and your odds of reaching 85, 90 and 95."

([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/facts-faqs/safety?utm_source=openai))\n- 2023 was 0.27 per 100,000 ≈ 1 in 370,000.

That’s a bit higher, but still the same ballpark. ([britishskydiving.org](https://britishskydiving.org/how-safe/?utm_source=openai))\n- Tandem students are lower risk again: about 1 student fatality per 500,000 tandem jumps on a long‑run average. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/about-uspa/uspa-news/its-a-wonderful-sport-and-more-people-should-know-it?utm_source=openai))\n\nAustralia doesn’t publish a simple national “per‑jump” index each year, but APF‑run operations use the same modern gear and procedures as the U.S./UK. So a practical working number for a licensed jumper in Australia is roughly 1 death in 200,000–500,000 jumps, depending on year, drop zone, and what kind of jumping you do. The U.S. figures above are a good, current benchmark. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/facts-faqs/safety?utm_source=openai))\n\nTwo nuances worth knowing as a 66‑year‑old active jumper:\n- The biggest technical contributors remain canopy‑related errors (especially low or high‑performance turns) and landing issues—things we can choose to avoid. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/a-step-backwardthe-2022-fatality-summary?utm_source=openai))\n- Medical events are a small but real slice of fatalities and become more relevant with age; staying on top of blood pressure, rhythm issues and hydration matters. ([uspa.org](https://www.uspa.org/about-uspa/uspa-news/safety-check-national-suicide-prevention-week-is-september-6-12?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you tell me roughly how many jumps you do a year and what kind (belly, wingsuit, HP landings, etc.), I’ll translate that into an annualised risk.

At 70 jumps/year ≈ 160 micromorts/year ≈ 0.016% per year (about 1 in 6,200).\n- Reasonable range (1 in 200,000 to 1 in 500,000 per jump): 0.035% to 0.014% per year (about 1 in 2,900 to 1 in 7,100).\n\nCumulative risk over time (using the 1-in-430,000 rate):\n- 10 years (≈700 jumps): about 0.16% (≈1 in 620).\n- 20 years (≈1,400 jumps): about 0.33% (≈1 in 300).\n- You’d need roughly 4,300 jumps to reach a 1% cumulative risk; at 70 per year that’s 60+ years.\n\nA few ways to keep yourself on the low end of the range:\n- Landings: no low turns, straight‑in patterns, be picky with winds/turbulence.\n- Gear: conservative wing loading, modern AAD, and RSL/MARD in place.\n- Currency and canopy drills: regular hop‑and‑pops, practise flares, PLFs when in doubt.\n- Health: hydrate, don’t push through dizziness/illness, keep blood pressure and rhythm issues checked—medical events are a small but growing slice with age.\n\nIf you want, tell me your canopy size/wing loading and whether you do any camera or big‑way stuff, and I’ll sanity‑check the assumptions and tweak the numbers."

      "content": "Short answer: with regular, proper servicing a 2019 Toyota Hilux 4x4 will commonly do 300,000–500,000 kilometres. With excellent care and luck you can push past 600,000 km and there are plenty of Hiluxes out there that have exceeded 1,000,000 km.\n\nWhy that range is wide\n- Hiluxes are built tough and are known for longevity, but actual life depends heavily on use and maintenance. Gentle highway use + strict servicing → much longer life than hard off‑road, heavy towing or frequent short trips.\n- “Regular servicing” means more than oil changes: it’s timely fluid and filter changes, attention to driveline, suspension, cooling system, and addressing small faults before they become big ones.\n\nPractical checklist to maximise life\n- Follow Toyota’s service schedule exactly (oil, oil filter, air filter, fuel filter, cabin filter). Usually every 10,000–15,000 km or 6–12 months depending on your owner’s manual.  \n- Use the recommended oils and genuine (or high‑quality OEM‑equivalent) parts.  \n- Change differential and transfer‑case oils at the recommended intervals (especially if you go off‑road or tow).  \n- Keep cooling system healthy: flush/replace coolant as scheduled, check hoses, thermostat and fan. Overheating kills engines.  \n- Diesel notes (if yours is diesel): do regular fuel‑filter changes, and do some longer highway runs occasionally to avoid DPF/regeneration problems.  \n- Transmission & clutch: service automatics per schedule; if manual, clutch life depends on driving/towing—replace before it fails completely.  \n- Brakes, suspension and steering: replace worn bushes, ball joints, shocks; worn suspension accelerates chassis wear.  \n- Rust prevention: underbody wash after salty roads or coastal trips, treat surface rust early.  \n- Diagnostics: investigate any warning lights or unusual noises promptly. Small repairs are far cheaper than major rebuilds.  \n- Keep records: a full service history dramatically helps longevity and resale.\n\nTypical “big ticket” items to expect eventually\n- Brake pads/rotors, shock absorbers, wheel bearings: routine.  \n- Clutch (manual) or transmission repairs (auto): depends on use.  \n- Turbocharger / injectors (diesel): more likely after high mileage or poor maintenance.  \n- Head gasket or engine rebuild: rare with proper care but possible at very high km.  \n- Rust repair / frame/body corrosion over many years (important in Australia’s coastal areas).\n\nIf you want a personalised estimate\nTell me: current odometer, engine (diesel 2.8 or petrol, manual or auto), typical driving mix (highway vs lots of suburb/short trips), and whether you tow or go off‑road. I’ll give a more tailored uptime estimate and a short maintenance plan for the next 100,000 km."

Short version first, then a clear maintenance plan you can use.\n\nShort answer\n- Given it’s a 2019 Hilux 2.8 auto, mainly highway driving, occasional off‑road farm work and regular servicing, it’s very reasonable to expect 300,000–500,000 km.  \n- With excellent, attentive care you can often push past 500,000 km; some Hiluxes do 600k+ or even 1,000,000 km, but those are the exception and require meticulous upkeep.\n\nWhy that range\n- The 1GD‑FTV 2.8 diesel in Hiluxes is built for long life. Highway use is gentle on the engine compared with lots of short trips or heavy towing, which helps a lot. Light‑to‑moderate off‑road work increases wear a little (suspension, seals, air intake contamination) but doesn’t rule out long life if addressed.  \n- “Regular servicing” and using the right fluids/filters is what moves you from “common” longevity into “excellent” longevity.\n\nPractical maintenance schedule and actions (what to do, and when)\nFollow Toyota’s official schedule where it differs — these are practical, commonly used intervals for longevity.\n\nEvery service (≈ every 10,000–15,000 km or 12 months)\n- Engine oil and oil filter (use a good full‑synthetic diesel oil that meets Toyota’s spec — many owners run 5W‑30 diesel‑grade oils; check your owner’s manual for the exact spec).  \n- Visual check of turbo, hoses, belts, cooling system, exhaust and underbody (especially after farm/off‑road days).  \n- Tyre rotation, brake check, top up fluids.  \n- Clear and record any warning lights; scan for ECU codes if anything odd.\n\nEvery 20,000–40,000 km\n- Fuel filter / water separator change (important for diesel longevity and injector health). If you do dusty/off‑road work, do this nearer the lower end.  \n- Air filter replacement when dirty (more frequent if dusty conditions).\n\nEvery 40,000–60,000 km (or sooner with heavy/off‑road use)\n- Differential and transfer‑case oil change (more often with hard off‑road / water crossings).  \n- Automatic transmission fluid/service — many operators recommend changing ATF and filter around 60k–100k km; do it earlier if you notice slipping, rough shifts, or heavy off‑road use. Follow Toyota’s schedule for the gearbox but err on the side of earlier change if you want maximum life.\n\nEvery 2 years\n- Brake fluid change (hydroscopic), battery health check and replacement as needed (batteries in Australia often last 3–5 years).  \n- Cabin filter change.\n\nEvery 100,000 km (or per Toyota)\n- Major inspections: turbo check, injector health/cleaning if needed, EGR/DPF inspection and service if soot is building, check timing‑chain tensioner (timing chain is more robust than a belt but still needs attention if noisy).  \n- Coolant flush as per Toyota schedule (usually every 5 years or as specified).\n\nOther important tips (behavioural and seasonal)\n- DPF care: take regular sustained highway runs to allow regeneration (especially if you do a lot of short trips). Use good quality diesel and avoid excessive idling.  \n- Turbo care: avoid aggressive shutdowns after heavy pulls — let the engine idle a minute or two if you’ve been working the turbo hard.  \n- Off‑road prep: wash underbody after muddy/salty work, check air intake and snorkel seals, check wheel bearings and CV boots.  \n- Watch for early warning signs: rising oil consumption, blue/black smoke, loss of power, unusual noises, coolant loss, transmission slipping, or warning lights — address these promptly.  \n- Keep full service records and use good quality parts/fluids; they matter at high kilometre counts.\n\nSigns a big job is approaching\n- Persistent oil consumption or blue smoke (rings/overhaul might be coming eventually).  \n- Hard shifting or slipping in the auto gearbox (transmission service or overhaul).  \n- Loss of boost or heavy smoke from the turbo (turbo rebuild/replacement).  \n- Repeated DPF clogging despite proper driving (diesel‑system work/injector issues).\n\nRough probabilities (very approximate)\n- Very likely to reach 300,000 km with proper servicing.  \n- Good chance (but not guaranteed) of reaching 400,000 km if you’re diligent.  \n- Reaching 500,000+ km becomes increasingly dependent on catching small problems early and replacing wear items before they cause secondary damage.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Turn this into a simple calendar of services for the next 100,000 km with reminder intervals.  \n- Estimate approximate servicing costs in Australia per interval (you tell me whether you prefer dealer or independent mechanic rates).  \n- Flag specific checks to do before major off‑road seasons.\n\nWhich of those would help most right now?"
