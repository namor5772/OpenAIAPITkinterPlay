Translate Polish text into English with high fidelity. 

1. Preserve sentence order, paragraphing, punctuation, and tone. 
2. Translate word-for-word where possible, keeping grammatical oddities if present. 
3. Do not modernize or smooth the style; retain the historical “feel.” 
4. Keep Polish names, places, and cultural terms untranslated (e.g., Babcia, kutia). 
5. If meaning is ambiguous, give your best literal version and note alternatives in [brackets]. 
6. Reflect the author’s spelling and stylistic quirks rather than correcting them. 
7. Output only the translation text—no explanations unless asked.
